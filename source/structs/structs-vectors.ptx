  <title>Structs and Vectors</title>

  <introduction>

    <p>Structs and vectors are similar in that they allow us to store multiple values in a package
      with a single name. But there are some important differences: <ul>
        <li>Every member of a struct can be of any type, while all members of a vector must be of
      the same type.</li>
        <li>The number of items in a struct is fixed by the defined members. A vector can grow or
      shrink.</li>
        <li>You can use a loop to traverse a vector or a variable to easily store an index. There is
      no equivalent way to loop through the members of a struct or specify one with a variable.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Thus, some <q>collections</q> of data are clearly best represented as structs. While others
      are clearly best represented as vectors. If the pieces of data you want to combine are of
      different types, you need a struct. To store a Person with a name (string) and age (int) you
      would need a struct. If the items are all the same type but the number of them can vary, you
      need a vector. If you are storing a list of the lines of text in a file, you would want a
      vector of strings. </p>
    <p> But there are times where we could use either a vector or a struct to store a given set of
      data. For example, we could store a mathematical point as a struct with two members, <pf>x</pf>
      and <pf>y</pf>, or we could store it as a vector with two elements (where x is at index 0 and y
      is at index 1). In these cases, we should consider how we will use the data to help decide
      which is best: <ul>
        <li>If it is natural to refer to items by name, a struct will let us write code that may be
      more readable. Say we are storing a Color. It is clearer to use <pf>c1.red</pf> instead of <pf>c1.at(0)</pf>
      to access the amount of red in the color. Thus we should probably prefer a struct.</li>
        <li>If you want to loop through items or pick them via a value stored in a variable, a
      vector is going to be necessary. We know a rectangle only has 4 corners, so we could store
      them in a struct that has <pf>corner1</pf>, <pf>corner2</pf>, <pf>corner3</pf>, and <pf>corner4</pf> members. But it would
      likely be easier to use a vector of points instead (<pf>corners</pf>) so we can write algorithms that
      loop through the points.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>So what if you need the strengths of booth?</p>
    <p>You can combine the two by using a vector inside of a struct, by making a vector of structs,
      or even by doing both at once.</p>

    <title>Structs containing Vectors</title>

    <p>Say we want to store students who have names and a list of exam scores. We would like to be
      able to loop through their scores to do things like calculate an average. We also need to be
      able to add scores. We could represent those scores as a vector of doubles within a <pf>Student</pf>
      struct:</p>

    <program>
struct Student {
  string name;
  vector&lt;double> exams;
};
</program>

    <p>Now a student is defined as something that has a name and an exams. The exams is a list
      (vector) of values. The memory diagram for a particular student would look something like
      this:</p>

    <figure align="center">
      <image source="images/structs-struct-vector.svg"
             width="40%">
        <shortdescription>A student struct with a name and exams fields</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>

    <p>To create that student, we could use a list of two items, in which the second item is a list
      to use for the exams:</p>

    <program>
Student student1 = {
  "Beth Jones",
  { 84.2, 94.3, 96.7 }
};
</program>

    <p>To access a particular exam score, we would use the dot operator to access the vector and
      then the dot operator again to use a method of the vector:</p>

    <program>
// Print the first exam score
cout &lt;&lt; student1.exams.at(0) &lt;&lt; endl;
// Print the number of exams
cout &lt;&lt; student1.exams.size() &lt;&lt; endl;
// Add a new score
student1.exams.push_back(100.0);
</program>

  };

  // Print the first exam score
