  <title>Values for Enums</title>

  <p>In general, you should not need to care about what numeric values each enum option
    represents.Although you can use a static cast to get or set the value, you would never want to
    say <pf>static_cast&lt;Suit>(1)</pf> instead of <pf>Suit::DIAMONDS</pf>.</p>

  <p>However, there are times when the enumerated values naturally map to integers. For example, if
    we are using the enumerated type to represent the rank of playing cards, it might be useful to
    have <pf>Rank::ACE</pf> have the value 1, <pf>Rank::TWO</pf> have the value 2, <pf>Rank::JACK</pf> have the value 11,
    etc.... That way we can take any rank and do a <pf>static_cast&lt;int></pf> to get its value.</p>

  <p>In this case, we want the lowest value used to be 1, not 0. We can do this by explicitly
    setting the value of the first item in the enum to 1. The rest of the values will be set
    automatically based on that first value. For example, if we want <pf>ACE</pf> to be 1, we can
    write:</p>

  <program>enum class Rank {
    ACE = 1, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
    SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN,
    JACK, QUEEN, KING
};</program>

  <p>Now <pf>ACE</pf> is 1, <pf>TWO</pf> is 2, and so on. The last value, <pf>KING</pf>, will be 13.</p>

  <p>We can even assign values to other items in the list. Say we want to represent US coin types.
    We could write:</p>

  <program>enum class Coin {
    PENNY = 1, NICKEL = 5, DIME = 10, QUARTER = 25
};</program>

  <p>Now we can use the enumerated type to represent the value of a coin. For example, if we want to
    represent a quarter, we can write:</p>

  <program>Coin myCoin = Coin::QUARTER;</program>

  <p>And if we want to get the value of that coin, we can write:</p>

  <program>int value = static_cast&lt;int&gt;(myCoin);</program>

  <p>And the value of <pf>value</pf> will be 25.</p>

  <p>There are some significant limitations to this technique. Every option needs a different value
    - you could not have <pf>Rank::JACK</pf>, <pf>Rank::QUEEN</pf>, <pf>Rank::KING</pf> all have the value 10 if you were
    programming a game where all of those cards should have the same value.</p>

  <p>Given this limitation, and the fact that <pf>getValue(myCoin)</pf> is much clearer to read than <pf>static_cast&lt;int>(myCoin)</pf>, it
    is likely better to use a function to turn enumerated options into the value we want them to
    represent. This function will give the correct value for each coin type, regardless of whether
    or not the enum was defined with specific numeric values:</p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/structs/structs_enum-values-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <insight>
    <p>Enumerated values are a great use case for <pf>switch</pf> statements. We have a finite list of
      items that all have unique integer values. We could write <pf>suitToString</pf> with if/else logic, but
      the switch is a little more succinct.</p>
