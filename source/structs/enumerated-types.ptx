  <title>Enumerated types</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Now that we know about structs, how might you represent a playing card? A playing card has
      two attributes: a suit and a rank. The suit can be one of four values: clubs, diamonds,
      hearts, or spades. The rank can be one of 13 values: ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack,
      queen, or king.</p>

    <p>One way to represent this information is to use two integers. For example, we could represent
      the suit as an integer from 0 to 3, and the rank as an integer from 1 to 13. This works, but
      it is not very clear, especially for the suit. Is suit 2 hearts? clubs? We would have to make
      a decision and remember it.</p>

    <p>We could use constants like <pf>const int HEART = 2;</pf> to help make the code clearer, but that would not
      prevent the code from setting a card's suit to be 534 instead of a value from 0 to 3.</p>

    <p>Another way to represent the suit would be to use strings like <pf>"Hearts"</pf> or <pf>"Clubs"</pf>. This
      works, but it is not very efficient. Strings take up more space than integers, and they are
      slower to compare. And again, there is nothing in this scheme that prevents the code from
      setting the suit of a card to be a string like <pf>"Unicorns"</pf> instead of <pf>"Hearts"</pf>.</p>

    <p>To describe a type of data where every value must be one of a fixed list of values (like
      heart, diamond, spade, or club), C++ provides a feature called an <term>enumerated type</term>
      or <term>enum class</term>. (Enumerate means to list things one by one.) To define an
      enumerated type we use the keyword <pf>enum</pf> followed by the name we want to give the type and
      then a list of the possible values:<idx>
        <h>enumerated type</h>
      </idx><idx>
        <h>enum</h>
      </idx></p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Defining an Enumerated Type</title>
    <p>For our playing card example, we could define an enumerated type <pf>Suit</pf> like this:</p>
    <program>enum class Suit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES };</program>

    <p>As with structs, enums are typically defined near the top of a code file so they are
      available everywhere after that point. If the enum is needed in multiple files, they should be
      defined in a header or module so all the files that need the definition can include it.And
      because the values are used much like constants, it is convention to give them all caps names
      as shown above.</p>


    <p>Once defined, we can use <pf>Suit</pf> as the data type and any of the possible values as
      constants in our code. Those values are referred to by using the syntax <pf>Suit::VALUE</pf>, which says <q>VALUE
      from the suit namespace</q>:</p>

    <program>
// Create a variable of type Suit and set to HEARTS
Suit leadSuit = Suit::HEARTS;
</program>


    <note>
      <p>C++ has an older, similar syntax for making an enum that skips the word <pf>class</pf>. That
        syntax is considered more dangerous as the values defined that way a) freely <q>decay</q>
        into integers; and b) become part of the global namespace, which can easily lead to name
        collisions (situations where the same name could mean multiple things - like <pf>BLACK</pf>
        referring to both a font color and a background color).</p>
    </note>

  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Enumerated Types and Integers</title>

    <p>Behind the scenes, each value of type <pf>Suit</pf> is represented by a different integer value.
      We can do a static cast to get the integer value of a Suit like this:</p>

    <listing>
      <program label="structs_enumerated-types-program-1"
               interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/structs/structs_enumerated-types-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
    </listing>

    <p>The values that are being used for each value come directly from the order they were declared
      in the <pf>Suit</pf> enum. <pf>CLUBS</pf> is the first option we listed, so it got the value 0. <pf>DIAMONDS</pf>
      was next, so it gets the value 1. And so on.</p>

    <p>Although the values are stored as integers, we can't use freely an enumerated value as an
      integer or an integer as an enumerated value. For example, the following code will not
      compile:</p>

    <program><![CDATA[
Suit mySuit = 1;        // ERROR: 1 is not a Suit
int i = Suit::CLUBS;    // ERROR: Suit::CLUBS is not an int
cout << Suit::CLUBS;    // ERROR: cout doesn't know what a Suit is
]]></program>

    <p>All of those uses would require a static cast to convert the integer into a Suit or the Suit
      into an integer:</p>

    <program><![CDATA[
Suit mySuit = static_cast<Suit>(1);       // OK - mySuit is now DIAMONDS
int i = static_cast<int>(Suit::CLUBS);    // OK, i is now 0
cout << static_cast<int>(Suit::CLUBS);    // Prints 0
]]></program>

  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Using Enumerated Types</title>

    <p>We can use our enumerated type not only as a variable but also as a parameter or return type
      for a function. And we can compare enumerated types using any comparison operators that would
      work on numbers. </p>

    <p>This code sample demonstrates a function <pf>dominantSuit</pf> that compares two suits and returns the
      larger of the two (the one with the higher value as defined by our ordering). It then passes
      that Suit to <pf>suitToString</pf> which returns a string describing the suit:</p>

    <listing>
      <program label="structs_enumerated-types-program-2"
               interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/structs/structs_enumerated-types-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
    </listing>

    <p>Key points to note: <ul>
        <li>There is no need to pass enums by reference. Suit is essentially just an integer.</li>
        <li>We can compare suits using <pf>></pf> and they get compared as numbers. When <pf>dominantSuit</pf> is
      passed <pf>Suit:DIAMONDS</pf> and <pf>Suit::HEARTS</pf>, it compares them using the values 1 and 2 respectively. It
      returns a copy of the value of the larger one, but it returns the <pf>Suit</pf> value, not the
      number.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
