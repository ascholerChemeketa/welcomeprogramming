  <title>Structs</title>
  <p>In C++, the simplest way to create a new aggregate data type is by defining a <term>struct</term>.
    A <pf>struct</pf> is a collection of variables, possibly of different types, that are grouped together
    under a single name.</p>
  <p>As a simple example, let us consider a point in the x, y plane. In mathematical notation,
    points are often written in parentheses, with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, <m>(0,
    0)</m> indicates the origin, and <m>(x, y)</m> indicates the point <m>x</m> units to the right
    and <m>y</m> units up from the origin.</p>
  <p>To create a new data type that represents a point, we can use this <pf>struct</pf> definition:</p>
  <program>struct Point {
  double x;
  double y;
};</program>

  <note><p>It is a common convention to name data types with capital letters.</p>
  <p>When using this convention, it is easier to distinguish types (<pf>Thing</pf>) from variables (<pf>thing</pf>).</p></note>

  <p>This definition indicates that there are two elements in this structure, named <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf>.
    These elements are called <term>instance variables</term> or <term>members</term>.<idx>
      <h>member</h>
    </idx><idx>
      <h>instance variable</h>
    </idx></p>
  <warning>
    <p>It is a common error to leave off the semi-colon at the end of a structure definition. It
      might seem odd to put a semi-colon after a squiggly-brace, but you'll get used to it.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>The <pf>struct</pf> definition must appear before it is used and be in scope where you use it. This
    means that they generally appear outside of any function definition, usually at the beginning of
    the program (after the <pf>include</pf> statements) so that they are available in all the functions. If
    building a program in multiple files, the struct definition generally goes into a header or
    module file that other files can import or include to make use of.</p>

  <p>A <term>struct</term> defines a new type of data. Think of it as a <q>blueprint</q> that
    describes how to build an item of that type. <pf>struct Point</pf> does not actually create a point anymore
    than the blueprint of a house gives you something to live in. To actually make a point that we
    can work with, we need to create a variable using the new data type that has been defined. The
    value that is created is referred to as an <term>instance</term> of the struct.<idx>
      <h>instance</h>
    </idx></p>
  <program>Point blank;
blank.x = 3.0;
blank.y = 4.0;</program>
  <p>The first line is a conventional variable declaration: <pf>blank</pf> has type <pf>Point</pf>. The next
    two lines initialize the instance variables of the structure. The <q>dot notation</q> used here
    is similar to the syntax for invoking a function on an object, as in <pf>myVector.size()</pf>.</p>
  <p>The result of these assignments is shown in the following state diagram:</p>
  <figure align="center">
    <image source="images/struct-point.png"
           width="40%">
      <shortdescription><pf>blank</pf> names a box that contains two parts. One is named <pf>x</pf> and the other is named <pf>y</pf>.</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>
  <p>As usual, the name of the variable <pf>blank</pf> appears outside the box and its value appears
    inside the box. In this case, that value is a struct with two named instance variables.</p>
