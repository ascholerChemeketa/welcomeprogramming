  <title>Structs</title>
  <p>In C++, the simplest way to create a new aggregate data type is by defining a <term>struct</term>.
    A <c>struct</c> is a collection of variables, possibly of different types, that are grouped
    together under a single name.</p>
  <p>As a simple example, let us consider a point in the x, y plane.
    In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses, with a comma separating the
    coordinates. For example, <m>(0, 0)</m> indicates the origin, and <m>(x, y)</m> indicates the
    point <m>x</m> units to the right and <m>y</m> units up from the origin.</p>
  <p>To create a new data type that represents a point, we can use this <c>struct</c> definition:</p>
  <program>struct Point {
  double x, y;
};</program>
  <p>This definition indicates that there are two elements in this structure, named <c>x</c> and <c>y</c>.
    These elements are called <term>instance variables</term> or <term>members</term>.<idx><h>member</h></idx><idx><h>instance variable</h></idx></p>
  <warning>
    <p>It is a common error to leave off the semi-colon at the end of a
      structure definition. It might seem odd to put a semi-colon after a
      squiggly-brace, but you'll get used to it.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>The <c>struct</c> definition must appear before it is used and be in scope where you use it. This means that they generally appear outside of any function definition, usually at the beginning of the
    program (after the <c>include</c> statements) so that they are available in all the functions. If building a program in multiple files, the struct definition generally goes into a header or module file that other files can import or include to make use of.</p>
    
  <p>A <term>struct</term> defines a new type of data. Think of it as a <q>blueprint</q> that describes how to build an item of that type. `struct Point` does not actually create a point anymore than the blueprint of a house gives you something to live in. To actually make a point that we can work with, we need to create a variable using the new data type that has been defined. The value that is created is referred to as an <term>instance</term> of the struct.<idx><h>instance</h></idx></p>
  <program>Point blank;
blank.x = 3.0;
blank.y = 4.0;</program>
  <p>The first line is a conventional variable declaration: <c>blank</c> has type <c>Point</c>. The next two
    lines initialize the instance variables of the structure. The <q>dot notation</q> used here is
    similar to the syntax for invoking a function on an object, as in <c>fruit.length()</c>.</p>
  <p>The result of these assignments is shown in the following state diagram:</p>
  <figure align="center">
    <image source="images/struct-stackdiagram.png"
           width="20%"
           alt="'blank' names a box with two halves. One is 'x: 3' the other is 'y: 4'."/>
  </figure>
  <p>As usual, the name of the variable <c>blank</c> appears outside the box and its value appears inside
    the box. In this case, that value is a compound object with two named instance variables.</p>

          This declaration would not work for the specific code block below.

          The specific name of the structure should be used, not its type.

        <feedback>
          Yes, we can access and modify the instance variables using the dot operator.

        <statement>
          <p>nice.x( ) = 3.0;</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          You are not calling a function therefore brackets for an argument list aren't required.
