<em>Operators</em> are symbols that represent simple computations.
For example, the addition operator is <c>+</c>, subtraction is <c>-</c>, multiplication is <c>*</c>, and division is <c>/</c>.
</p>

<p>
The following program converts a time of day to minutes:
</p>

<program>int hour = 11;
int minute = 59;
System.out.print("Number of minutes since midnight: ");
System.out.println(hour * 60 + minute);</program>

<p>
The output is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
Number of minutes since midnight: 719
</output>
</console>

<p>
<idx><h>expression</h></idx>
<idx><h>operand</h></idx>
In this program, <c>hour * 60 + minute</c> is an <em>expression</em>, which represents a single value to be computed (<c>719</c>).
When the program runs, each variable is replaced by its current value, and then the operators are applied.
The values that operators work with are called <em>operands</em>.
</p>

<p>
Expressions are generally a combination of numbers, variables, and operators.
When compiled and executed, they become a single value.
For example, the expression <c>1 + 1</c> has the value <c>2</c>.
In the expression <c>hour - 1</c>, Java replaces the variable with its value, yielding <c>11 - 1</c>, which has the value <c>10</c>.
</p>

<p>
In the expression <c>hour * 60 + minute</c>, both variables get replaced, yielding <c>11 * 60 + 59</c>.
The multiplication happens first, yielding <c>660 + 59</c>.
Then the addition yields <c>719</c>.
</p>

<p>
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication all do what you expect, but you might be surprised by division.
For example, the following fragment tries to compute the fraction of an hour that has elapsed:
</p>

<program>System.out.print("Fraction of the hour that has passed: ");
System.out.println(minute / 60);</program>

<p>
The output is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
Fraction of the hour that has passed: 0
</output>
</console>

<p>
<idx><h>division</h><h>integer</h></idx>
<idx><h>integer division</h></idx>
This result often confuses people.
The value of <c>minute</c> is <c>59</c>, and 59 divided by 60 should be 0.98333, not 0.
The problem is that Java performs <em>integer division</em> when the operands are integers.
By design, integer division always rounds toward zero, even in cases like this one where the next integer is close.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative, we can calculate a percentage rather than a fraction:
</p>

<program>System.out.print("Percent of the hour that has passed: ");
System.out.println(minute * 100 / 60);</program>

<p>
The new output is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
Percent of the hour that has passed: 98
</output>
</console>

<p>
Again the result is rounded down, but at least now it's approximately correct.
