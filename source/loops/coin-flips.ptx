  <title>Coin Flips</title>

  <p>Now that we know how to generate random numbers, let us try to do a simulation of coin flips.</p>

  <p>If we flip a coin, we expect to get heads about half the time and tails about half the time.
    Sometimes we will get a few heads or tails in a row. But longer streaks of all heads or tails
    are less likely. It is twice as hard to get 3 heads in a row as to get 2. And twice as hard
    again to get 4 heads in a row. So let's flip some coins and see how long it takes to get 4 heads
    in a row.</p>

  <p>To simulate flipping a coin, we need to map the possibilities to different numbers. Let's call
    tails 0 and heads 1. Flipping a coin is then the same as picking either 0 or 1, which we can do
    with <pf>randRange(0, 1)</pf>. Any time we want to pick something at random, we can apply the same
    basic strategy. Say we want to pick a random day of the week. There are seven days, so we could
    use <pf>randRange(0, 6)</pf> or <pf>randRange(1, 7)</pf> and then map each possible number to a different day
    of the week (i.e. 0 means "Sunday", 1 means "Monday", etc...)</p>

  <p>Let's start with a simple test of this idea. We will make a loop that counts until 10. In the
    loop we will generate a random number and use that to print "Heads" or "Tails":</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="loops_coin-flips-program-1"
           interactive="activecode"
           compile-also="SimpleRandom-cxx" extra-compiler-args="-std=c++20 -fmodules-ts">
<xi:include href="../../programs/loops/flips-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>Now we need to keep track of how many heads in a row we have seen. We will need a variable to
    store the current streak. We will start it at 0. Every time we see a head, we will increment the
    streak. Every time we see a tail, we will reset the streak to 0. The variable will need to be
    initialized once before the start of the loop - we do not want to initialize it inside the loop
    or it will reset with each flip.</p>

  <exercise label="loops_coin-flips-ex-1">
    <statement>
      <p>Fix the missing parts of the code below. They are marked with <pf>???</pf>. To make sure we see
        some longer streaks, we are now flipping 100 coins - you will need to scroll the output area
        to see all of it.</p>
    </statement>
    <program
             interactive="activecode"
             compile-also="SimpleRandom-cxx" extra-compiler-args="-std=c++20 -fmodules-ts">
<xi:include href="../../programs/loops/flips-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </exercise>

  <p>Once we are satisfied that works, we can worry about our real goal. We want to keep flipping
    until we get 4 heads in a row and then stop. We could add something like this at the end of our
    loop body:</p>

  <program>
if (headStreak == 4) {
    break;
}
  </program>

  <p>But there is no guarantee we will see 4 heads in the first 100 flips. We could make the loop
    count to 1000, but it is still possible (although very unlikely) we wouldn't see 4 heads.</p>

  <p>The real problem here is that our problem involves counting, but the loop we need is not a <term>counting
    loop</term> We need a <term>sentinel value loop</term> - one that stops when <pf>headStreak</pf> is 4.
    Our counter is something extra we are doing, not what drives the loop logic.</p>
