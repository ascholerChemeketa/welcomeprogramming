  <title>Increment and Decrement</title>

  <p>Here is another <pf>while</pf> loop example; this one displays the numbers 1 to 5: </p>

  <program xml:id="loops_increment-decrement-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/loops/increment-decrement-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>increment</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>decrement</h>
    </idx> Assignments like <pf>i = i + 1</pf> don't often appear in loops, because C++
    provides a more concise way to add and subtract by one. Recall that, <pf>++</pf> is the <term>
    increment</term> operator; it has the same effect as <pf>i = i + 1</pf>. And <pf>--</pf> is the <term>
    decrement</term> operator; it has the same effect as <pf>i = i - 1</pf>. </p>

  <p>We introduced these <q>shortcut operators</q> back in <xref ref="variables-operators_shortcut-operators"/>. There, we said there is no reason you have to use them, but you should learn to recognize them as they are commonly used. Loops are the most important example of this. Programmers will almost always write <pf>i++</pf> or <pf>++i</pf></p>

  <note><p>In C++, there are some differences between <pf>i++</pf> and <pf>++i</pf> that can make the choice of which to use important. If you are using them as part of a larger expression, the placement of the <pf>++</pf> changes when the increment happens. If you are using <pf>++</pf> on more complex structures, the preincrment version - <pf>++i</pf> - can be more efficient than the post increment version. When used on their own with integer variables it does not matter which you use. But it is not a bad habit to get used to writing <pf>++i</pf> by default.</p></note>

  <p>If you want to increment or decrement a variable by an amount other than <pf>1</pf>, you can use <pf>+=</pf>
    and <pf>-=</pf>. For example, <pf>i += 2</pf> increments <pf>i</pf> by <pf>2</pf>: </p>

  <program xml:id="loops_increment-decrement-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/loops/increment-decrement-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p> And the output is as follows: </p>

  <console>
    <output>
2, 4, 6, 8, Who do we appreciate?
</output>

      <p>The super evil villian RePete wants to annoy the city by
        hacking into the city's helper robots and making them repeat
        everything they say 5 times. However, there's an error in his
        code and now the robots won't stop repeating! Can you find the
        error?</p>

        <feedback>
          The initialization of <pf>n</pf> occurs outside the <pf>while</pf> loop, so the value of <pf>n</pf>

        <feedback>
          Since <pf>n</pf> starts at 0 and gets smaller, the conditional for the <pf>while</pf> loop will
            always be true, and thus the code runs forever.
