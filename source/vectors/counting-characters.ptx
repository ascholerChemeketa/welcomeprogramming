  <title>Case Study: Counting Characters</title>

 DRAFT!!!!

  <introduction>

    <p>We now return to the example from the beginning of the chapter. Recall that we would like to
      figure out how often each letter of the alphabet appears in a string. To do this efficiently,
      we want to only traverse the string once. That means we need to keep track of 26 separate
      values - how many 'a's, 'b's, 'c',... we have seen so far.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Understanding the problem</title>

    <p>Any time we need to work with a list of related values a vector is a logical choice. In this
      case, we need to store 26 integers (one for each letter). Rather than create 26 variables, we
      can create a single vector of integers with 26 elements, one for each letter of the alphabet.
      The only missing ingredient is how to map the letters of the alphabet to the indexes of our
      vector. When we see <pf>'a'</pf> we need to know that it belongs in element index 0. When we see
      <pf>'b'</pf> we need to know that it belongs in element index 1.</p>

             source="images/vectors-letter-counts.svg"/>
    </figure>

    <p>We could use a large if/else chain (or a switch statement) to determine the right index for
      each character. But since chars are inherently numeric, we can instead do some math. <pf>'a'</pf> has
      the value 97. <pf>'b'</pf> has the value 98, <pf>'c'</pf> the value 99, and so on. So <pf>'a' - 'a'</pf> equals 0.
      <pf>'b' - 'a'</pf> equals 1. <pf>'c' - 'a'</pf> equals 2. If we subtract <pf>'a'</pf> from a character we are
      essentially calculating <q>how far is this letter from 'a?'</q>. And that value tells exactly
      what index the character belongs to!</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Starting the code</title>

    <p>Before we even start writing code, let's think about how we might separate the work of counting
      the letters from the code that sets up the string we want to count letters in and the code that displays the output.
    </p>

    <p>We know we will be starting with a string. For testing, we will hard code in a particular string. Later, we might want to 
      modify the code to read from a file or get input from the user. But for now, hard coding is fine. We also know that we will
      need to create a vector of 26 integers to hold our counts. Once we have those, we will need to print them out.
    </p>

    <p>In the middle, where we go from a string to a vector of counts, seems like a good place to make a function. Something like:</p>

    <program><![CDATA[
      // Given a string, count the number of times each letter appears
      // and return those counts in a vector of integers.
      // The vector at index 0 holds the count for 'a',
      // index 1 holds the count for 'b', and so on.
      vector<int> countLetters(const string& text);
      ]]>
    </program>

    <listing>
    <program label="vectors_counting-characters-program-0"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/counting-characters-0.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>
    </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Starting the code</title>

    <p>Sometimes we need to do some setup before we can write the code that we really want to write.
      In this case, we need to loop through some string, and for each character figure out what
      index it belongs to. There is no use trying to keep counts until we are sure we can do that.
      So let us start with just some code to iterate through a string and print out each character,
      followed by the index it belongs in:</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="vectors_counting-characters-program-1"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/counting-characters-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>

    <p>Testing out that code, it seems like there are a few problems: <ul>
        <li>Upper case <pf>T</pf> gets a different index than <pf>t</pf></li>
        <li>We are getting spaces, newlines, and punctuation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>So let us convert everything to lower and ignore anything that is not alphabetical:</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="vectors_counting-characters-program-2"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/counting-characters-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>

    <p>That looks better.</p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Keeping count</title>

    <p>Now we are ready to do the work we originally set out to do - to keep count of how many times
      each letter appears. We need to declare a vector of 26 int's before we start the loop and make
      sure each is initialized to 0. Then, in our loop, we need to use the index to pick an element
      from the vector to increment. To confirm that this is working, we will print out the new count
      for that letter each time we make a change:</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="vectors_counting-characters-program-3"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/counting-characters-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>

    <p>That seems to be working well.</p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Cleanup and Final Output</title>
    
    <p>Now we can remove the extra printing from the loop that
    traverses the string. After that traversal, we can traverse the vector to print out the values.
    We want to print the index as well as the value of each element, so we will use a counting loop:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="vectors_counting-characters-program-4"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/counting-characters-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>This
    is looking good. But it is a little tricky to read the output. To figure out how many <pf>'t'</pf>s
    there are, we need to do some mental math. Let's make it easier to read by printing out the
    letter instead of the index. We can do this by adding <pf>'a'</pf> to the index and casting it to a
    char. Try modifying the code in the final loop to look like this:</p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/counting-characters-5.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
