  <title>Accessing Consecutive Elements</title>

  <p>Sometimes while traversing, we want to compare one element with another. For instance, if we
    want to see if values in a vector are in order we can check each value to make sure it is larger
    than the previous one. For example, in a four item vector, if the 2nd element is larger than the
    1st, and the 3rd is larger than the 2nd, and the 4th is larger than the 3rd, we know that all
    four elements are in order.</p>

  <p>To compare every item with the previous, it is generally easiest to use a counting loop instead
    of a range-based loop. Our counting variable (typically <pf>i</pf>) represents <q>the current index</q>.
    Assuming we are counting up, the next lower value, <pf>i - 1</pf>, would be the <q>previous index</q>
    and the next high value, <pf>i + 1</pf>, would be <q>the next index</q>. Thus <pf>vec.at(i)</pf> is the <q>current
    element</q>, <pf>vec.at(i - 1)</pf> is the <q>previous element</q> and <pf>vec.at(i + 1)</pf> is the <q>next
    element</q>.</p>

  <p>When using <pf>i - 1</pf> or <pf>i + 1</pf>, we have to adjust our loop to make sure we do not go out of
    bounds on the vector. If we start counting from 0, and try to access <pf>i - 1</pf>, we would end up
    with index <pf>-1</pf>, which would cause an exception. So we should start our loop at index 1. Pay
    special attention to lines 10 and 12 in this sample. By starting the loop counter at 1, we know
    it will be safe to check the previous index:</p>

           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/accessing-consecutive-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>If we want to access the next value at <pf>i + 1</pf>, we need to make sure our loop stops in time to avoid accessing the item at index <pf>size()</pf>.
    (Index <pf>size() - 1</pf> is the index of the last element!) So the last value <pf>i</pf> reaches should <pf>i = size() - 2</pf>. That way, when we calculate <pf>i + 1</pf>, we get
    <pf>size() - 1</pf>, which is the last valid index.</p>
