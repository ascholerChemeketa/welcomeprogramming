  <title>Complex Collections</title>

  <p>
    Much like how we can make a vector of vectors to create a 2D table, we can also make collections that contain other collections of different types. This allows us to create more complex data structures.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example, we might want to represent all the models of cars made by different manufacturers. We could use a <pf>map</pf> where the keys are the manufacturer names (strings) and the values are <pf>vectors</pf> of model names (also strings). This way, we can easily look up all the models for a given manufacturer. The type for such a collection would be:
  </p>

  <program>
    <![CDATA[
    map<string, vector<string>> carModels;
    ]]>
  </program>

  <p>The keys in this map are strings like <c>"Toyota"</c> or <c>"Ford"</c>. Each value is a vector, like: <c>{"Camry", "Corolla", "Prius"}</c>. Here is an example of what using it might look like:</p>

  <program label="practical-programming_complex-collections-1" interactive="activecode"
           line-numbers="yes" >
<xi:include href="../../programs/practical-programming/complex-collections-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <exercise label="practical-programming_complex-collections-exercise-1">
    <statement>
      <p>Arrange blocks to declare a collection called <pf>classList</pf> that is a map which lets us use <pf>Course</pf> objects to loop up vectors of <pf>Student</pf> objects.</p>
    </statement>
    <blocks layout="horizontal"
            randomize="yes">
      <block><c>map&lt;</c></block>
      <block><c>Course</c></block>
      <block><c>,</c></block>
      <block><c>vector&lt;</c></block>
      <block><c>Student</c></block>
      <block><c>&gt;&gt;</c></block>
      <block><c>classList</c></block>
      <block><c>;</c></block>
    </blocks>
  </exercise>
