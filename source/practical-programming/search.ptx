  <title>Search Algorithms</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Another category of algorithms are algorithms that find elements in a collection.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Find and FindIf</title>

    <p>Find and find if do what you might expect: they search for elements in a collection. The <q>if</q>
    version accepts a function to use to decide if an element matches the search criteria while the <q>plain</q> find accepts a value to search for.</p>

    <p>To return their result, they use an iterator. It will either point at the found element or at the end of the range if no matching element is found.</p>
    
    <program>
      <![CDATA[
      It find( It first, It last, const T& value );
      
      It find_if( It first, It last, UnaryPredicate p );
      ]]>
    </program>

         line-numbers="yes" >
<xi:include href="../../programs/practical-programming/search-1.cpp" parse="text"/>

<p><pf>find</pf> does a forward search. It starts from the beginning and works towards the end, stopping at the first match. If we want to do a backwards search that begins at the end and works towards the beginning, we can use <pf>find_last</pf> (or <pf>find_last_if</pf>).</p>
  </subsection>


  <subsection>
    <title>Count</title>

    <p>Perhaps we want to know how many matches there are for a certain value or that satisfy a certain condition.We don't want to move them or remove them, we just want to know how many there are. In that case, <pf>count</pf> or <pf>count_if</pf> have us covered.</p>

    <p>The count algorithms are called just like find, but they return a count of the matching elements instead of an iterator to the first match</p>
