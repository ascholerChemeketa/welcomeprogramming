<idx><h>inheritance</h></idx>
<idx><h>generalization</h></idx>
When we first looked at inheritance in <xref ref="eights">Chapter</xref>, our purpose was to avoid duplicating code.
We noticed that <q>decks of cards</q> and <q>hands of cards</q> had common functionality, and we designed a <c>CardCollection</c> class to provide it.
This technique is an example of <em>generalization</em>.
By generalizing the code, we were able to reuse it in the <c>Deck</c> and <c>Hand</c> classes.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>specialization</h></idx>
In <xref ref="conway">Chapter</xref>, we looked at inheritance from a different point of view.
When designing <c>GridCanvas</c> to represent a grid of cells, we extended <c>Canvas</c> and overrode its <c>paint</c> method.
This design is an example of <em>specialization</em>.
Using the code provided by <c>Canvas</c>, we created a specialized subclass with minimal additional code.
</p>

<p>
We didn't write the code for <c>Canvas</c>; it's part of the Java library.
But we were able to customize it for our own purposes.
In fact, the <c>Canvas</c> class was explicitly designed to be extended.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of inheritance more fully and present event-driven programming.
We'll continue to develop graphical simulations as a running example, but this time in varying shapes and colors!
