<title>BigInteger Arithmetic</title>
<p>
It might not be clear at this point why you would ever need an integer object when you can just use an <c>int</c> or <c>long</c>.
One advantage is the variety of functions that <c>Integer</c> and <c>Long</c> provide.
But there is another reason: when you need very large integers that exceed <c>Long.MAX_VALUE</c>.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>BigInteger</h></idx>
<c>BigInteger</c> is a Java class that can represent arbitrarily large integers.
There is no upper bound except the limitations of memory size and processing speed.
Take a minute to read the documentation, which you can find by doing a web search for <q>Java BigInteger</q>.

To use BigIntegers, you have to <c>import java.math.BigInteger</c> at the beginning of your program.
There are several ways to create a BigInteger, but the simplest uses <c>valueOf</c>.
The following code converts a <c>long</c> to a <c>BigInteger</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="immutable-objects_biginteger-arithmetic-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/immutable-objects/biginteger-arithmetic-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
You can also create BigIntegers from strings.
For example, here is a 20-digit integer that is too big to store using a <c>long</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="immutable-objects_biginteger-arithmetic-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/immutable-objects/biginteger-arithmetic-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Notice the difference in the previous two examples: you use <c>valueOf</c> to convert integers, and <c>new BigInteger</c> to convert strings.
</p>

<p>
Since BigIntegers are not primitive types, the usual math operators don't work.
Instead, we have to use functions like <c>add</c>.
To add two BigIntegers, we invoke <c>add</c> on one and pass the other as an argument:
</p>

<program xml:id="immutable-objects_biginteger-arithmetic-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/immutable-objects/biginteger-arithmetic-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Like strings, <c>BigInteger</c> objects are immutable.
functions like <c>add</c>, <c>multiply</c>, and <c>pow</c> all return new BigIntegers, rather than modify an existing one.
</p>

<p>
Internally, a <c>BigInteger</c> is implemented using an array of <c>int</c>s, similar to the way a string is implemented using an array of <c>char</c>s.
Each <c>int</c> in the array stores a portion of the BigInteger.
The functions of <c>BigInteger</c> traverse this array to perform addition, multiplication, etc.
</p>

<p>
For very long floating-point values, take a look at <c>java.math.BigDecimal</c>.
Interestingly, <c>BigDecimal</c> objects represent floating-point numbers internally by using a <c>BigInteger</c>!
