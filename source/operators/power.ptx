  <title>Importance of Operators</title>

  <p>As a quick demonstration of the important ways operator overloads are used in C++, we will
    borrow an idea from the future. There is an <pf>&lt;algorithms></pf> library that has a <pf>sort</pf> function. It
    can be used on a vector to sort it:</p>

  <listing>
  <program interactive="activecode" label="operators_power-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/operators/power-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Pretty easy! (We will learn much more about <pf>sort</pf> later.)</p>

  <p> Now let's try the same trick with our own Time class. Don't worry too much about time (it just
    stores an hour and minute). Just trying running the code. </p>

  <listing>
  <program interactive="activecode" label="operators_power-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/operators/power-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Somewhere in the wall of errors you should see <pf>error: no match for ‘operator&lt;’</pf>. The compiler refuses to build the
    code because the <pf>sort</pf> function uses the <pf>&lt;</pf> operator to compare the objects. And
    there is no <pf>&lt;</pf> operator for time.</p>

  <p>If we <b>create</b> an operator overload for <pf>&lt;</pf> in Time the code will compile and run.
    This next sample does so. Again, don't worry about the details yet. Just notice that there are a
    few lines of code for <pf>operator&lt;</pf> and that the <pf>sort</pf> function works. </p>

  <listing xml:id="operators-power-3-listing">

    <program interactive="activecode" label="operators_power-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/operators/power-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Any class can be made sortable by the <pf>sort</pf> function simply by implementing an overload
    that defines how <pf>&lt;</pf> works for that data type. Whoever wrote the <pf>sort</pf> code does not
    need to know anything about our data type other than one object of that class can be asked <q>are
    you less than this other object?</q>. We get to reuse the existing <pf>sort</pf> code instead of
    having to write a new version for our data type.</p>

  <p>This same basic idea could be accomplished by having sortable items all implement a <pf>compareTo(other)</pf>
    method that the <pf>sort</pf> function relied on. Indeed, that is how languages that do not support
    operator overloads would approach reusing <pf>sort</pf>. But in C++, the expectation is often that
    generic behaviors like <q>less than</q> or <q>add to</q> will be implemented by operators.</p>
