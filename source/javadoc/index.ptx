Java programs have three types of comments:
<ul>
<li>
<title>End-of-line comments:</title>
<p>
These start with <c>//</c> and generally contain short phrases that explain specific lines of code.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Multiline comments:</title>
<p>
These start with <c>/*</c> and end with \relax<c>*/</c>, and are typically used for copyright statements.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Documentation comments:</title>
<p>
These start with <c>/**</c> and end with \relax<c>*/</c>, and describe what each class and function does.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
End-of-line and multiline comments are written primarily for yourself.
They help you remember specific details about your source code.
Documentation comments, on the other hand, are written for others.
They explain how to use your classes and functions in other programs.

    <idx><h>HTML</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Javadoc</h></idx>
A nice feature of the Java language is the ability to embed documentation in the source code itself.
That way, you can write it as you go, and as things change, it is easier to keep the documentation consistent with the code.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>JDK</h></idx>
You can extract documentation from your source code, and generate well-formatted HTML pages, using a tool called <term>Javadoc</term>.
This tool is included with the JDK, and it is widely used.
In fact, the official documentation for the Java library (<url href="https://thinkjava.org/apidoc"/>) is generated by Javadoc.
