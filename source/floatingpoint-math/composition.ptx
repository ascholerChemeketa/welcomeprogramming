    </idx> You have probably learned how to evaluate simple expressions like <m>
    \sin(\pi/2)</m> and <m>\log(1/x)</m>. First, you evaluate the expression in parentheses, which
    is the argument of the function. Then you can evaluate the function itself, either by hand or by
    punching it into a calculator. </p>

  <p> This process can be applied repeatedly to evaluate more-complex expressions like <m>
    \log(1/\sin(\pi/2))</m>. First we evaluate the argument of the innermost function (<m>\pi/2 =
    1.57</m>), then evaluate the function itself (<m>\sin(1.57) = 1.0</m>), and so on. </p>

    </idx> Just as with mathematical functions, C++ functions can be <term>
    composed</term> to solve complex problems. That means you can use one function as part of
    another. In fact, you can use any expression as an argument to a function, as long as the
    resulting value has the correct type: </p>

  <program xml:id="floatingpoint-math_composition-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/composition-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p> This statement divides <pf>PI</pf> by <pf>2.0</pf>, adds the result to <pf>angle</pf>, and computes the cosine
    of the sum. </p>

  <p>Here is another example you may remember from geometry. Given the lengths of legs <pf>a</pf> and <pf>b</pf>
    in a right triangle, you can find the length of the hypotenuse <pf>c</pf> with <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}</m>.
    Here is that translated to C++</p>

  <program xml:id="floatingpoint-math_composition-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/composition-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p> Before <pf>sqrt</pf> can do its job, we need to compute its argument by doing the <pf>+</pf>. But
    before that can happen, the two <pf>pow</pf> calls must run. So, they happen first. Then their
    results are added together. Finally, the square root is taken. </p>

  <warning><p>Just because you can use composition to nest a large number of steps into one line of code, does not mean that you should. This is perfectly legal:</p>
  <program>
  sqrt(pow(hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1), 2) + pow(hypot(x4 - x3, y4 - y3), 2) - 2 * hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1) * hypot(x4 - x3, y4 - y3) * cos(angleC));
  </program>
  <p>But it is hard to read and will be even harder to debug if you make a mistake somewhere on the line. It also redoes the same work in multiple spots. It would be much better to write that code as a series of steps that calculate the desired value.</p>
  </warning>
