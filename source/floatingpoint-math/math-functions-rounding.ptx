  <title>Rounding Functions</title>

  <p>At this point, you should take a minutes to scan the <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath">list
    of functions offered in the cmath library</url>. You do not need to memorize them, but it is
    useful to be aware of what is there so you can go look up the exact syntax when you need to do
    some math.</p>

  <p>Notice that the functions are listed in categories. One of the categories is named <term>Nearest integer floating-point operations</term>, which is a long-winded way of saying <q>rounding</q>.</p>

  <p>If you have a floating-point value and want to convert it to a whole number, one way you can do
    so is to cast it into an int. But that always drops the decimal portion. So something like
    7.9999 will become 7. Often times, what you want to do is to round to the nearest integer value (8).
    Other times, you might want to round up to the next nearest value <mdash/> if you calculate that a print job takes 7.2
    pages, the actual number of pages printed will be 8.</p>

  <p>For rounding in this way, the <pf>cmath</pf> library provides these rounding functions: <pf>floor</pf>, <pf>ceil</pf>
    , <pf>round</pf>, and <pf>trunc</pf>: <dl>
      <li><title>
          <pf>floor</pf>
        </title> rounds down to the nearest whole number</li>
  <li><title>
          <pf>ceil</pf>
        </title> rounds up to the next nearest integer</li>
  <li><title>
          <pf>round</pf>
        </title>rounds to the nearest integer</li>
  <li><title>
          <pf>trunc</pf>
        </title><term>truncates</term> (removes) the decimal part of the number</li>
    .
  </dl> The following program demonstrates their use:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="floatingpoint-math_math-functions-rounding-program-1"
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/math-functions-rounding-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>When you run this program, you will see that <pf>floor</pf> rounds down to the nearest whole number, <pf>ceil</pf>
    rounds up to the nearest whole number, <pf>round</pf> rounds to the nearest whole number, and <pf>trunc</pf>
    truncates the decimal part of the number. Experiment with different test values to see how they
    are rounded.</p>

  <p>If you look at the <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/round">
    documentation for the round function</url> (or any of the others), you will see that despite the
    output being a whole number, it is returned as a <pf>double</pf>. This makes it easy to continue
    doing more floating-point calculations with the value. But it means that to store the result as an <pf>int</pf>, you need to cast the result:</p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/math-functions-rounding-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>You also may notice that round only rounds to the nearest whole number. But you can use it to
    round to a specific number of decimal places by multiplying the original number by a power of 10
    to shift the digits, then rounding, and then dividing by the same number to shift the digits
    back. For example, to round to two decimal places, you can multiply by 100 to shift the decimal point over 
    2 digits, round, and then divide by 100 to move the decimal point back:</p>
