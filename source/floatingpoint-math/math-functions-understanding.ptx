  <title>Finding and Understanding Functions</title>

  <p>You can learn about
  what functions are available to use in a library by checking documentation of it (or by reading the code of the library). One useful source of
  documentation for C++ is <url href="https://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</url>. If you use
  the search function on that site to search for <q>sqrt</q>, you should find this page: <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/sqrt">
  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/sqrt</url>. On that page is the syntax for the
  function, the library (header file) you need to include, a description of the function and
  examples of how to use it.</p>

  <p>The information on documentation pages can be a bit
  overwhelming. They include technical details that you probably don't need to worry about. (Unless
  something goes wrong, in which case those details might explain the issue you have!) The most
  important part for our purpose is the listing of function prototypes at the top of the page. They
  look something like:</p>

  <program>
float       sqrt ( float num );
double      sqrt ( double num );                    (until C++23)
long double sqrt ( long double num );
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* floating-point-type */                           (since C++23)
            sqrt ( /* floating-point-type */ num ); (constexpr since C++26)
...
  </program>

  <p>Again, they can look overwhelming at first. The key
  is to focus on the information that is useful to us. We are writing code with <pf>double</pf>s. The second
  line in the listing above shows that there is <pf>double sqrt ( double num );</pf>. There are also versions that work with <pf>float</pf>s
  and <pf>long double</pf>s, but we are not concerned with those (see <xref ref="floatingpoint-math_other-size-types"/>
  ).</p>

  <!-- TODO add a pretty picture of prototypes -->

  <p>Once we find the right listing, we just need to
  figure out what it says. Something like <pf>double sqrt ( double num );</pf> is known as a <term>function prototype</term>. A function prototype generally consists of three parts: <pf>returnType  functionName ( paramters )</pf>
  <dl>
      <li>
        <title>returnType</title>
        <p>First is listed the type of data that will be returned by the function. <pf>sqrt</pf> will
  calculate and return a double.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>functionName</title>
        <p>Next is the name of the function. You call the square root function using the name <pf>sqrt</pf>
  .</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>parameters</title>
        <p>Finally, in parentheses, a list of zero or more parameters separated by commas. Each
  parameter is described with a type and a name. In this case, <pf>sqrt</pf> takes one parameter, a double
  that is referred to as <q>num</q>. To use this function, you have to pass it a double.</p>
  <p>While using
  the function, you don't actually need to know the name of the parameter. But as we will see soon,
  the name can help you figure out exactly what you are supposed to pass in.</p>
      </li>
    </dl></p>
  
  <insight>
    <p>You can think of a function prototype as a contract between the caller and the
    function. The function promises that if the caller gives it the correct parameters (inputs), it will
    return a specific output.</p>
  </insight>

  <p>Lets
  look at another prototype - this time we will look at the one for the <pf>pow</pf> function. The
  prototype for <pf>pow</pf> is <pf>double pow ( double base, double exponent );</pf>. (You can check it yourself at <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/pow">
  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/pow</url>). This tells us that: <ul>
      <li>The function returns a double to the caller</li>
      <li>It is called <q>pow</q></li>
      <li><p>It takes two parameters, both of which are doubles and that the first parameter is the <q>
  base</q> and the second is the <q>exponent</q>.</p>
  <p>Here, having the names is important. They help me figure out which value I need to pass first. If I want to calculate <m>2^5</m>, I need to call <pf>pow(2, 5)</pf>. If I called <pf>pow(5, 2)</pf> I would be asking for <m>5^2</m></p></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>To call this function, I will need to provide two doubles. When there is more than one parameter to pass, we use commas to separate them. So to calculate <m>2.5^3</m> I could do:</p>

  <program xml:id="floatingpoint-math_math-functions-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/math-functions-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>Again,
  note that the pow function does not change any parameters. <pf>x</pf> remains unmodified after being
  passed to pow. Also, notice that we can pass the integer 3 to the function even though it expects
  a double. That is because an integer can always safely be converted to a double.</p>

  <exercise label="floating_point_2">
    <statement>
      <p>Complete this line of code to call the <pf>pow</pf> function and raise the number 5.2 to the power <pf>n</pf> (assume n is a variable that is already initialized).</p>

      <p><pf>double result = </pf><fillin mode="string" case="insensitive" answer="pow\s*\(\s*5.2\s*,\s*n\s*\)"/><pf>;</pf></p>
    </statement>
    <evaluation>
      <evaluate>
          <test>
            <strcmp use-answer="yes"/>
          </test>
          <test>
            <strcmp>pow\s*\(\s*n\s*,\s*5.2\s*\)</strcmp>
            <feedback>
              Your variables are in the wrong order.
            </feedback>
          </test>
          <test>
            <strcmp>.*</strcmp>
            <feedback>
              Remember you need the name of the function fpllowed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses should be the two values you are passing to the function with a comma between them.
