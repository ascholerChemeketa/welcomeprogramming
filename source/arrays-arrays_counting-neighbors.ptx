<title>Counting Neighbors</title>

<idx><h>neighbor</h></idx>
Now that you know about <c>try</c> and <c>catch</c>, we can use them to implement a useful method in <c>GridCanvas</c>.
Part of the GoL logic is to count the number of live neighbors.
Most cells have eight neighbors, as shown in <xref ref="fig_neighbors">Figure</xref>.
</p>

<p>
However, cells on the edges and in the corners have fewer neighbors.
If we try to count all possible neighbors, we'll go out of bounds.
The following method uses a <c>try</c>-<c>catch</c> statement to deal with these special cases:
</p>

<program>public int test(int r, int c) {
    try {
        if (array[r][c].isOn()) {
            return 1;
        }
    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        // cell doesn't exist
    }
    return 0;
}</program>
  <figure xml:id="fig_neighbors" >
<caption>Cells in the interior of the grid have eight neighbors.

</figure>
<p>
The <c>test</c> method takes a row index, <c>r</c>, and a column index, <c>c</c>.
It tries to look up the <c>Cell</c> at that location.
If both indexes are in bounds, the <c>Cell</c> exists.
In that case, <c>test</c> returns <c>1</c> if the <c>Cell</c> is on.
Otherwise, it skips the catch block and returns <c>0</c>.
</p>

<p>
If either index is out of bounds, the array lookup throws an exception, but the catch block ignores it.
Then <c>test</c> resumes and returns <c>0</c>.
So the non-existent cells around the perimeter are considered to be off.
</p>

<p>
Now we can use <c>test</c> to implement <c>countAlive</c>, which takes a grid location, <c>(r, c)</c>, and returns the number of live neighbors surrounding that location:
</p>

<program>private int countAlive(int r, int c) {
    int count = 0;
    count += grid.test(r - 1, c - 1);
    count += grid.test(r - 1, c);
    count += grid.test(r - 1, c + 1);
    count += grid.test(r, c - 1);
    count += grid.test(r, c + 1);
    count += grid.test(r + 1, c - 1);
    count += grid.test(r + 1, c);
    count += grid.test(r + 1, c + 1);
    return count;
}</program>

<p>
Because <c>test</c> handles <q>out of bounds</q> exceptions, <c>countAlive</c> works for any values of <c>r</c> and <c>c</c>.
</p>
