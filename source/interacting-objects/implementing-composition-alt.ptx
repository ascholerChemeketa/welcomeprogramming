  <title>Point.h and Point.cpp</title>

  <p>This is the <pf>Point</pf> class implemented as a .h/.cpp file pair. Note that the .h file only includes what is necessary to define the names used in the class definition (<pf>&lt;string></pf>). We avoid using <pf>using namespace std</pf> so that files that include this .h do not have to deal with possible name conflicts that might cause.</p>

  <p>In the .cpp file, we include the .h file (and thus get <pf>&lt;string></pf> indirectly). We also include any other files required to define items we are going to use in the function bodies (<pf>&lt;format></pf> and <pf>&lt;cmath></pf>).</p>
