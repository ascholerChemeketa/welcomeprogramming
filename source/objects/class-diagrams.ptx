  <title>Class Diagrams and Documentation</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Code is written to communicate algorithms to computers. But it also serves an important role
      in communicating ideas from one programmer to another.</p>
    <p>The more complex the code, the more important this communication is. Complex code bases rely
      on abstractions to make them more manageable. But abstractions only help when programmers
      understand those abstractions.</p>
    <p>To help communicate to other programmers how a given class works, we often rely on both
      written documentation and visual diagrams.</p>

        <h>UML</h>
      </idx>
<term>Unified Modeling Language</term> (UML) is a graphical language
      for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software system.
      There are many different kinds of diagrams used in UML and we won't attempt to cover them all.</p>

    <p>UML <term>class diagrams</term> are one of the most common types of UML diagrams. A class
      diagram defines a graphical way to summarize the state (member variables) and behaviors
      (member functions or methods) of an object.</p>
    <p> Each class is represented by a box with three sections. The top section has the name of the
      class. The next section a list of member variables. And the last section has a list of the
      methods. <idx>
        <h>class diagram</h>

        <h>class</h>
      </idx></p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Format of a class diagram</caption>
      <image>
        <mermaid>
        classDiagram
            class ClassName{
              -memberVariable: type
              +memberFunction(param: type) returnType
            }
            </mermaid>
      </image>
    </figure>


    <p>The diagram format is fairly simple, but there are a few quirks to get used to. The sections
      are used to store variables and methods, not private versus public members. In UML, the plus
      sign (<pf>+</pf>) identifies a <pf>public</pf> member while a minus sign (<pf>-</pf>)
      indicates a <pf>private</pf> one. Usually, all of the variables (second section) will be
      private and all of the functions (third sections) will be public. But if there is a private
      function, it still belongs in the third section.</p>
    <p>In addition, UML is designed to be language independent. So it does not use the syntax of any
      particular programming language. Instead, it uses a language-independent syntax. To identify
      the types of members, parameters, and return types UML places them after the variable or
      function name. For example, in UML we write <pf>x: int</pf> rather than C++ syntax, <pf>int x</pf>.
      When a function has the return type <pf>void</pf>, we simply do not specify a type for that
      function.</p>

    <p>Here is what a class diagram for a version of the Point class that includes a private <pf>
      check</pf> function looks like:</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Point class diagram. Note the private <pf>check</pf> function still belongs in the
        third section of the diagram with the other methods.</caption>
      <image>
        <mermaid>
      classDiagram
          class Point{
            -m_x: double
            -m_y: double
            +Point(x: double, y: double)
            +getX() double
            +getY() double
            +setX(x: double)
            +setY(y: double)
            +distanceToOrigin() double
            -check() bool
          }
          </mermaid>
      </image>
    </figure>

    <insight>
      <p>Class diagrams show a class. They represent information about data types available to the
        compiler. There is only one Point class no matter how many Point objects get created.</p>
      <p>Other types of diagrams, like memory diagrams focus on particular objects that exist at run
        time. A memory diagram might show multiple Point objects because we can create many
        instances of the class.</p>

    <title>Doxygen for Classes</title>
    <p>When writing documentation for a class, we typically want to document all of the functions.
      They typically include the entire public portion of the interface to the class. And that is
      the part that other programmers should be interacting with. In addition, it is a good idea to
      comment the class itself with a description of what it is intended to represent.</p>
    <p>We do not necessarily need to document the member variables as they are the hidden
      information other programmers shouldn't be worried about. But to help anyone who does need to
      maintain the class, it can be useful to add comments with any key information about them. For
      instance, if our point class assumed that the units were centimeters, and that was important
      for anyone working on the code to understand that, we would likely want to document that next
      to <pf>m_x</pf> and <pf>m_y</pf>.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of what documentation for a partial version of the Point class might looks
      like:</p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/objects/documentation-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
      </program>

    <note>
      <p>As noted when we introduced <xref ref="functions-testing_documentation" text="custom">Doxygen</xref> style commenting for functions, we often omit the full
        comments for classes in this text. This is done to minimize the amount of code you need to
        read through to find what is new or interesting in each example.</p>
      <p>Any class (or organization) you write code for will likely expect you to produce well
        documented classes.</p>
