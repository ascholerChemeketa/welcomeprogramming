  <title>Why Objects</title>

  <p>Every feature of a programming language is designed to solve some problem. Sometimes those
    problems are fundamental to writing algorithms - there are many problems we could not solve
    without the ability to write a conditional like <pf>if</pf> statement. Other times, those
    problems are ones of convenience - the <pf>+=</pf> operator does enable us to solve any problems
    we can't solve with <pf>x = x + ?</pf>. Understanding what problem a language feature is
    designed to solve can help us understand how and why a feature works as it does and how
    important it is to master that feature.</p>

  <p>In this chapter, we are learning about objects. So what problem are objects designed to solve?</p>

  <p>Objects do not enable us to solve any new kind of problem that could not be solved without
    objects. There are programming languages that lack objects entirely and are still capable of
    solving any problem that can be solved with a computer.</p>

  <p>Objects do not make is easier or quicker to express an idea. In fact, they often require more
    code and structure to express an algorithm. This means more code for programmers to write and
    more code for the computer to run.</p>

  <p>The problem objects are designed to address is that of managing complexity in code. As programs
    get complex, it becomes difficult or even impossible for a programmer to know every detail about
    every part of the program. We need ways for individuals to start working on a program without
    understanding all of those details.</p>

  <p><term>Object oriented programming</term>, or <term>OOP</term>, is the process of designing
    and writing a program using objects as our most important building block. OOP has proven helpful in building large software
    systems where programmers working on one part of a program can relatively easily and safely make use of other parts that they may only partially understand.</p>

  <p>The style of programming we have done up until now is known as <term>procedural programming</term>
    because the main way we design a program is by designing functions (which also can be called
    procedures). Well designed procedures can also help manage complexity. There are programs with
    millions of lines of code that have been successfully written in the procedural style. However,
    object oriented programming gives us tools that help us enforce boundaries in the code.</p>

  <insight>
    <p>It helps to imagine all object oriented code being written by two different programmers.
      There is one programmer who is writing the code for the object. That programmer is responsible
      for all the low level details of how the object will do its job. The other programmer just
      wants to use the object. They should not need to know much at all about the internals of the
      object. They should just</p>
    <p>When you are working by yourself, do your best to wear these two different hats. There is the <q>
      you</q> who creates the objects and the <q>you</q> who uses the objects. We will use the term <term>client
      code</term> to refer to code that makes use of an object despite not being a part of it.</p>
    <p>Don't assume that the <q>you</q> that is working on client code knows everything the <q>you</q>
      who is building an object knows!</p>
