  <title>When to Use References</title>

  <p>So when should you pass by value, reference, or constant reference? Here is a comparison of the three methods and when you should use them.<ul>
      <li>
        <term>Pass by value: <pf>func(type name)</pf></term>
        <ul>
          <li>Parameter is a copy of passed data.</li>
          <li>Use when passing a small piece of data (int, double, char). Copying these is no more expensive than making a reference.</li>
          <li>Use when passing a large piece of data and you want a copy.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <term>Pass by reference: <pf>func(type&amp; name)</pf></term>
        <ul>
          <li>Parameter is an alias for the passed variable.</li>
          <li>Use when passing a large piece of data (string, vector) and you want the function to modify
    that data.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <term>Pass by const reference: <pf>func(const type&amp; name)</pf></term>
        <ul>
          <li>Parameter is an alias for the passed variable but can't be used to modify it.</li>
          <li>Passing a large piece of data (string, vector) and you do NOT want the function to
    modify that data.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul></p>

  <p>Of course, any set of rules will have its exceptions. But the guidelines above describe the preferred method for most situations.</p>

  <p>A final point is that a literal value can't be passed into a function by reference. The reference needs to point at a storage location, not a value. If there is a function <pf>void foo(string&amp; s)</pf> the following would cause a compiler error:</p>

  <program>
    // error: can't pass a literal by reference
    foo("hello world");
  </program>

  <p>The error message would be something like <pf>cannot bind non-const lvalue</pf>. Storing the string into a variable and passing that variable would work:</p>

  <program>
    string s = "hello world";
    foo(s);
  </program>

  <insight>
    <p>When in doubt, pass by value. It is the safest option. If you are going to pass by reference, favor using a const reference. Passing off data to another function and letting that function modify the data tends to <q>hide</q> what is happening and make it harder to reason about what a chunk of code does. A const reference avoids making extra copies but protects us from unwanted side effects that change data unexpectedly.</p>
