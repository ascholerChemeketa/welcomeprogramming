  <title>Constant References</title>

  <p>Pass by reference allows a function to modify the data it is passed. This can be useful,
    especially if we are working with a large piece of data. Imagine we have a function to make a
    string lower case. If that string uses pass by value, it needs to make a copy of my string,
    modify that copy, then return the copy so the caller can use the new string. For a very long
    string, that making those extra copies could be expensive. If the function uses pass by
    reference, it can just modify the string that was passed in without having to make copies.</p>

  <p>Sometimes we want to pass a reference to a function to avoid extra copies but we don't want
    that function to be able to modify the data. Say we have a function <pf>countEs</pf> that will count
    the number of <pf>E</pf>s that appear in the string. We don't want the function to change the string,
    which <pf>countEs(string&amp; s)</pf> would allow. But we also don't want to copy the parameter, which
    <pf>countEs(string s)</pf> would do.</p>

  <p>The solution is to use a <term>const reference</term>. A <term>const reference</term> is a
    reference that promises not to change the data that is being pointed to: <pf>add(const int&amp;
    x)</pf>. Remember that it helps to read declarations backwards. In this case, we would read <pf>const int&amp;
    x</pf> as<q>x is a reference to an int that
    shall remain constant</q>. The compiler will treat that declaration as a promise. If you write
    any code that tries to modify what the const reference points at, it will be a compile error:</p>

  <insight>
    <p>Other than one detail described below, declaring a reference to be <pf>const</pf> doesn't allow it
      to do anything new. It just asks the compiler to help avoid accidental changes to the
      referenced value. It is a way for a function to make a binding promise to the caller: <q>you
      are going to give me access to some of your memory, but I promise I won't change that memory.</q>
    </p>
    <p>The one extra things you can do with a const reference: a <pf>const</pf> reference is allowed to
      reference a const variable (a normal constant). A normal reference is not allowed to.
      Otherwise we could use the reference to change the <pf>const</pf>. We won't need to use this feature.</p>
