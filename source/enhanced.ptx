<title>The Enhanced for Loop</title>
<p>
Since traversing arrays is so common, Java provides an alternative syntax that makes the code more compact.
Consider a <c>for</c> loop that displays the elements of an array on separate lines:
</p>

<program>for (int i = 0; i &lt; values.length; i++) {
    int value = values[i];
    System.out.println(value);
}</program>

<p>
We could rewrite the loop like this:
</p>

<program>for (int value : values) {
    System.out.println(value);
}</program>

<p>
<idx><h>enhanced for loop</h></idx>
<idx><h>for</h><h>enhanced</h></idx>
This statement is called an <em>enhanced for loop</em>, also known as the <q>for each</q> loop.
You can read the code as, <q>for each <c>value</c> in <c>values</c></q>.
It's conventional to use plural nouns for array variables and singular nouns for element variables.
</p>

<p>
Notice how the single line <c>for (int value : values)</c> replaces the first two lines of the standard <c>for</c> loop.
It hides the details of iterating each index of the array, and instead, focuses on the values themselves.
</p>

<p>
Using the enhanced <c>for</c> loop, and removing the temporary variable, we can write the histogram code from the previous section more concisely:
</p>

<program>int[] counts = new int[100];
for (int score : scores) {
    counts[score]++;
}</program>

<p>
Enhanced <c>for</c> loops often make the code more readable, especially for accumulating values.
But they are not helpful when you need to refer to the index, as in search operations:
</p>

<program>for (double d : array) {
    if (d == target) {
        // array contains d, but we don't know where
    }
}</program>
