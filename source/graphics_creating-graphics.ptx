There are several ways to create graphics in Java; the simplest way is to use <c>java.awt.Canvas</c> and <c>java.awt.Graphics</c>.
A <c>Canvas</c> is a blank rectangular area of the screen onto which the application can draw.
The <c>Graphics</c> class provides basic drawing methods such as <c>drawLine</c>, <c>drawRect</c>, and <c>drawString</c>.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example program that draws a circle by using the <c>fillOval</c> method:
</p>

<program>import java.awt.Canvas;
import java.awt.Graphics;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class Drawing extends Canvas {</program>
  
<program>public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("My Drawing");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        Drawing drawing = new Drawing();
        drawing.setSize(400, 400);
        frame.add(drawing);
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.fillOval(100, 100, 200, 200);
    }
}</program>

<p>
The <c>Drawing</c> class extends <c>Canvas</c>, so it has all the methods provided by <c>Canvas</c>, including <c>setSize</c>.
You can read about the other methods in the documentation, which you can find by doing a web search for <q>Java Canvas</q>.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>JFrame</h></idx>
In the <c>main</c> method, we do the following:
<ol>
<li><p>Create a <c>JFrame</c> object, which is the window that will contain the canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <c>Drawing</c> object (which is the canvas), set its width and height, and add it to the frame.</p></li>
<li><p>Pack the frame (resize it) to fit the canvas, and display it on the screen.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>paint</h></idx>
Once the frame is visible, the <c>paint</c> method is called whenever the canvas needs to be drawn; for example, when the window is moved or resized.
If you run this code, you should see a black circle on a gray background.
</p>

<p>
The application doesn't end after the <c>main</c> method returns; instead, it waits for the <c>JFrame</c> to close.
When the <c>JFrame</c> closes, it calls <c>System.exit</c>, which ends the program.
