  <title>Typedefs</title>

  <p>C++ data types can sometimes become a bit much to efficiently read or type:
    <ul>
    <li><p><pf>vector&lt; vector&lt;int> ></pf> - a two dimensional vector of integers</p></li>
    <li><p><pf>vector&lt; vector&lt;int> >::iterator</pf> - an iterator over a two dimensional vector of integers</p></li>
    <li><p><pf>map&lt; char, vector&lt;string> ></pf> - a map of characters to vectors of strings</p></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>To make it easier to read and write, we can use a <term>typedef</term>. A <pf>typedef</pf> is a way to give a new name to an existing type. The new name can be shorter or more descriptive. The basic syntax is:</p>

  <program>typedef EXISTING_TYPE NEW_NAME;</program>

  <p>For example, we could  give the name <pf>Matrix</pf> to the type <pf>vector&lt; vector&lt;int> ></pf> like this:</p>
  <program>typedef vector&lt; vector&lt;int> > Matrix;</program>

  <note><p>It is a common convention to capitalize new data types or names for data types. That way, when you see <pf>Matrix</pf> you can guess it is the name of a type of data, not the name of a piece of data.</p></note>

  <p>A typedef like this would normally go outside of any particular function near the top of a code file so that it is available everywhere in that file. If we are building a program with multiple files and want to use the same typedef across many of them, we would write it in a .h file or module that gets included in all the places it is needed.</p>

  <p>Once we have made the <pf>typedef</pf> we can use <pf>Matrix</pf> instead of <pf>vector&lt; vector&lt;int> ></pf> in our code. So the function that takes a two dimensional vector of integers could be written as:</p>

  <program>void foo(const Matrix&amp; m);</program>

  <p>The new name and the old are interchangeable - they are just different names the same type of thing. So it is perfectly legal to mix and match the names when working with items of that type:</p>

  <listing>
  <program><![CDATA[ 
  // IntTable is a type alias for vector<vector<int>>
  typedef vector<vector<int>> IntTable;
  // Make a 2D vector
  vector<vector<int>> table = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
  // Use type alias to make a reference
  IntTable& table2 = table;
  ]]></program>
  </listing>

  <p>It should be noted that overusing typedef can make code less readable. Especially if it is used to assign new names to simple types. Don't use typedef to make <pf>Decimal</pf> mean <pf>double</pf>!</p>

      <p>Which statement best describes what a typedef does?</p>

            It is used to declare a variable of a particular type.

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Typedefs are used to give names to data types, not individual variables. We then use the defined type to declare variables later.</p>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>It gives an alternative name to an existing type.</p>
        </statement>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>It defines a new type of data.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>A typedef is always based on an existing type.</p>
