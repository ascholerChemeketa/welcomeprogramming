  <title>Single Responsibility Principle</title>

  <p>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a key concept in software design that states that
    a function should only do one thing. This means that a function should have a single,
    well-defined purpose and should not be responsible for multiple tasks or concerns.</p>

  <p>A simple example of this principle in action is a function that calculates the area of a
    rectangle. This function should only be responsible for the area calculation and not for any
    other tasks, such as printing the result or validating input. By keeping the function focused on
    a single responsibility, we make it easier to understand and maintain. Other functions should be
    responsible for different tasks, such as displaying the result or handling user input.</p>

  <p>A poorly designed function might look like <pf>calculateTriangleArea</pf> in this sample:</p>
<listing> 
  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/program-design/area-calculation-bad.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
 </listing>
  <p> That function is doing three different jobs: <ul>
      <li>Getting user input</li>
      <li>Calculating the area</li>
      <li>Printing the result</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p> This makes the function less flexible. What if we want to calculate the area of a triangle and
    then use that value to do more calculations? We can't do that easily because the result is just
    sent to <pf>cout</pf>. There is no way for other code to access the value produced inside that
    function.</p>

  <insight>
    <p>Getting user input and printing out results are distinct tasks from working with data. They
      should generally not be a part of functions that perform calculations or data processing.</p>
    <p>Only a function that's responsibility is getting input should use <pf>cin</pf>. Only a function
      that's responsibility is printing output should use <pf>cout</pf>.</p>
  </insight>

  <p>It also makes it harder to test each individual part of the function. There is no way to test
    that the area calculation is correct without also testing the input and output. If we want to
    change how the area is calculated, we have to change the entire function, which can introduce
    bugs in the other parts of the function. In this example, there is an extra complication<mdash/>it
    is much more challenging to build unit tests that work with <pf>cin</pf> and <pf>cout</pf> than it is to write
    ones that check the values returned from functions.</p>

  <p>We can fix the <pf>calculateTriangleArea</pf> by giving it the single responsibility of doing the
    necessary math:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="program-design_single-responsibility-program-1" interactive="activecode" linenumbers="yes" highlight-lines="7-11">
    <stdin>
3
4
5
    </stdin>
    <code>
<xi:include href="../../programs/program-design/area-calculation-better.cpp" parse="text"/>
    </code>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>Now, if we want to use the results of <pf>calculateTriangleArea</pf> for further calculations, we can easily do so because it
    returns a value. For example, we could use it to help build a program that compares two triangles in order to
    decide if one is larger than the other.</p>

  <program>
double areaA = calculateTriangleArea(10, 10, 10);
double areaB = calculateTriangleArea(7, 12, 13);
if (areaA > areaB) {
    ...
  </program>

  <p>We can also write an automated unit test for <pf>calculateTriangleArea</pf> to ensure it behaves as expected:</p>

  <listing>
  <program>
TEST_CASE("calculateTriangleArea") {
    CHECK(calculateTriangleArea(3, 4, 5) == doctest::Approx(6));
    CHECK(calculateTriangleArea(2.5, 4.1, 6.25) == doctest::Approx(3.20322));
    CHECK(calculateTriangleArea(0, 3, 3) == doctest::Approx(0));
}
  </program>
  </listing>
