  <title>Function Length</title>

  <subsection>
    <title>Challenges with Long Functions</title>

    <p>Function length is the squishiest of the three principles we have listed. There is no hard and
      fast rule about how long a function should be. However, longer functions are generally harder to
      understand and maintain. Anytime a function starts approaching 15+ lines of code, it is worth
      thinking about whether it can be simplified or broken down into smaller functions.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, a long function is a sign of some other problem, like violating the single
      responsibility principle. But length itself increases the cognitive load on the programmer
      reading the code.</p>

    <p>There is a famous finding in cognitive psychology that places the human
      working memory at about 7±2 items. A person can remember about 5 to 9 pieces of information in
      their head at once. To remember more than that requires committing some of the information to
      long-term memory or <q>chunking</q> items.</p>

    <p>A common example - if you are trying to remember a phone number, you normally don't think of it as a series of 10 items like: <c>5 0 3 5 5 5 3 2 5 1</c>. Instead, you mentally group the numbers into chunks: <c>503</c>, <c>555</c>, and <c>3251</c>. Thinking of <c>503</c> as a group instead of three digits reduces the number of things you are trying to remember at once. (And if you are used to the <c>503</c> area code, you already will have a long-term mental chunk for it.)</p>

    <p>When a programmer is reading through a function, the 7±2 mental limit applies to the things they are trying to keep track of. Rather than try to remember each symbol and word, good programmers mentally <q>chunk</q> code that they are reading to stretch what they can keep track of. Instead of thinking of <pf>cin >> variable1</pf> as three separate pieces of information (<pf>cin</pf>, <pf>>></pf> and
      <pf>variable1</pf>), they might think of the whole chunk as <q>get input into variable1</q>. They will even
      chunk multiple lines into a single mental group: <q>oh, those 5 lines just calculate the <pf>triangleArea</pf></q> and then stop paying attention to the details inside that <q>chunk</q>.</p>

    <note>
      <p>Programmers often use blank lines to break parts of a function into distinct blocks. This helps the reader spot the logic that the writer used while <q>chunking</q> the code.</p>

      <listing>
      <program>
        // Get inputs (chunk 1)
        cin >> variable1;
        cin >> variable2;
        cin >> variable3;

        // Calculate values (chunk 2)
        variable4 = variable1 + variable2;
        variable5 = variable2 * variable3;
        variable6 = variable4 + variable5;

        // Output results (chunk 3)
        cout &lt;&lt; "The result is: " &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; variable6 &lt;&lt; endl;
      </program>
      </listing>
    </note>

    <p>These tricks are how we use our memory capacity of 7ish items to read and understand code that
      is much longer than 7 lines. But if a function is too long, or the logic is too complex to easily chunk, it will become harder to understand the code. We will have to reread the logic multiple times before being able to grasp how all the parts fit together.</p>

    <p>Longer functions are also more difficult to test and debug. If a test reveals that a 100 line
      function has a bug, there are 100 possible lines of code where the bug could be. If a 15 line
      function has a bug, there is simply less code to wade through. (It is also likely that the
      shorter function is less complex, making each line that much easier to understand!)</p>
    
    <warning>
      <p>The number of lines of code in a function is only a rough measure of its complexity. Fitting
        more logic into fewer lines does not necessarily make the function simpler or easier to
        understand.</p>
      <p>It is often easier to read 15 lines of simple, straightforward code than 5 lines of code that
        is using complex syntax and fancy tricks to pack the same work into fewer characters. Each
        line in the simple code can be quickly read and then mentally chunked. The short complex code
        likely requires the reader to slow down and carefully parse each line, making it harder to
        grasp the overall logic.</p>

    <title>Dealing with Function Length</title>
    <p>If a function starts feeling long, we should stop and decide: Is it trying to do too much?
      Are there subtasks it can be broken into?</p>
    
    <p>Look for groups of lines in the function that work together to produce a single
      value or perform a single task. Consider breaking each of those groups into their own functions.</p>
      
    <p>For example, maybe inside a 15 line function you do 5 lines of calculations to get <pf>triangleArea</pf>:</p>
    
      <program>
        ... 5 lines of code that set x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ...

        double side1 = sqrt(x1, y1, x2, y2);
        double side2 = sqrt(x1, y1, x3, y3);
        double side3 = sqrt(x2, y2, x3, y3);
        double s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;
        double triangleArea = sqrt(s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3));

        ... 5 lines of code that use triangleArea ...
      </program>

    <p>The shown lines only depend on the x and y variables. The lines after them only depend on the final value of <pf>triangleArea</pf>. So we could <q>chunk</q> them into a separate function <pf>getTriangleArea</pf>. Then the 15 line function could be shorted to:</p>

      <program>
        ... 5 lines of code that set x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ...

        double triangleArea = getTriangleArea(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3);

        ... 5 lines of code that use triangleArea ...
      </program>

    <p>Occasionally, there are
      algorithms that involve a significant number of tightly interrelated steps. In
      those cases you may not be able to cleanly break out parts of the logic. But in many cases, there will
      be opportunities to simplify and clarify the code by breaking it into smaller pieces.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Too Short Functions</title>
    <p>Can functions be too short? Not really. There is a slight amount of processing overhead
      involved in calling a function. In theory it is faster to just do <pf>int area = length * width;</pf>
      than to call a function that does the same work: </p>

    <program>
    // Too short??? Probably not!
    int  calculateRectangleArea(int length, int width) {
        return length * width;
    }
    </program>

    <p>However, compilers do all kinds of optimizations that can eliminate that overhead. Any modern
      compiler will likely generate the same machine code for <pf>int area =
      calculateRectangleArea(length, width);</pf> as it would for the code <pf>int area = length * width;</pf>.</p>

      <p>
      So, in practice, there is likely no performance difference. Thus the benefits of using functions
      (like improved readability and maintainability) far outweigh the costs. The reader who sees
      <pf>calculateRectangleArea</pf> will immediately understand what it does, without having to mentally
      parse the implementation details (<q>hrmmm, <pf>length * width</pf>, oh that is just calculating the
      area</q>). And if we ever need to fix a bug with our calculation, we can do so in one place
      without having to find and change every instance of <pf>length * width</pf> in our code.</p>
