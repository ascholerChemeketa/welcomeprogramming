  <title>Using Arrays</title>

  <p>To use the elements of a heap allocated array, you use the <term>subscript operator</term>
    (square brackets) after the pointer that points to the array to specify the index of the element
    you wish to use. The index can be a literal or an expression that evaluates to an integer:</p>

  <listing>
  <program>
    // Allocate an array of 3 integers - uninitialized
    int* data = new int[3];
    data[0] = 1; // set the first element to 1
    data[1] = 2; // set the second element to 2

    int location = 2;
    data[location] = 3; // set the third element to 3

    // print the first element
    cout &lt;&lt; "data[0]: " &lt;&lt; data[0] &lt;&lt; endl;
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Diagramed, the result of this would look like:</p>

  <image source="images/array-use-0.svg">
    <shortdescription>data holds the address 0x40. At that address is an array that holds three
      integers: 1 and 2</shortdescription>
  </image>


  <note>
    <p>The <pf>[]</pf> syntax may look familiar. It is what we said NOT to use with vectors or
      strings. Vectors and strings are wrappers around dynamically allocated arrays. They provide <pf>[]</pf>
      to access the elements as if you were using a raw array. But usually you want to use <pf>at()</pf>
      instead, as it performs bounds checking and can help prevent accessing invalid memory.</p>
    <p>Plain arrays do not provide a <pf>at()</pf> or any other way to access elements that will perform
      bounds checking. It is completely up to the programmer (with the help of other tools like
      AddressSanitizer) to avoid accessing invalid memory.</p>
  </note>

  <p>When you use the name of the pointer that points to the array, you are referring to the memory
    address of the array and not its contents. This means that expressions like <pf>data == other</pf> will not
    compare the contents of the arrays, but rather the memory addresses of the arrays. For example,
    in the memory diagram below, we see two different pointers, <pf>data</pf> and <pf>other</pf>, both
    pointing to arrays containing 1, 2, and 3. <pf>data == other</pf> would evaluate to false because it compares
    the pointers (the two memory addresses), not the things they point at.</p>

         >

    <shortdescription>data holds the address 0x40. At that address is an array that holds three integers: 1, 2, and 3. other holds the address 0x80. At that address is a different array that also holds three integers: 1, 2, and 3.</shortdescription>

  </image>

  <p>This also means that something like <pf>int* copy = data;</pf> will not create a copy of the array, but rather
    another pointer to the same array. Given this code:</p>

  <program>
    // Allocate an array of 3 integers - initialized to 1, 2, and 3
    int* data = new int[3] {1, 2, 3};

    int* copy = data; // copy points to the same array as data
  </program>

  <p>The memory layout would look like:</p>

  <image source="images/array-use-2.svg"
         >

    <shortdescription>data holds the address 0x40. At that address is an array that holds three integers: 1, 2, and 3. copy holds the same address</shortdescription>

  </image>

  <p>There is really only one array, and both <pf>data</pf> and <pf>copy</pf> point to it. The assignment
    statement copied the memory address from data to copy. This is known as a <term>shallow copy</term>.
    If you modify the contents of the array using either pointer, the changes will be reflected when
    accessing the array through the other pointer.</p>

  <insight>
    <p>In <pf> int* data = new int[3];</pf>, <pf>data</pf> is the name of the pointer that is tracking the array. It does NOT
      name the array.</p>
  </insight>

  <p>To do something like compare two arrays, or to copy one array to another, you generally need to
    use a loop to work with each element one at a time. This Codelens demonstrates making a copy of
    an array using a loop:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="memory-management_using-arrays-program-1"
           interactive="codelens">
<xi:include href="../../programs/memory-management/using-arrays-loop.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <note>
    <p>The range-based for loop will not work on a dynamically allocated array. (There is no
      guarantee the compiler will know the size of the array.) You have to use a counting loop to
      iterate through the elements.</p>
  </note>

  <p>In this code, <pf>copy</pf> would be called a <term>deep copy</term> because it allocates its own
    memory and copies the contents of the original array into it. Once the copy is made, changing
    either array will not affect the other.</p>


  <warning>
    <p>It should be clear that arrays are a very low-level way of working with memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In C programming, there
      are no vectors available, so arrays are the way we store a list of items. In
      C++, we have the option to use the Standard Template Library (STL) which provides higher-level
      abstractions like <pf>std::vector</pf> and <pf>std::array</pf>.</p>
    <p>We will only generally use plain arrays while learning to build data structures like vectors that
      manage the array for us.</p>
