  <title>Arrays</title>

  <p>Often we need to allocate space to store more than one value. Perhaps we need to allocate space
    for 1000 integers or 200 Person objects. In C++, we can use arrays to achieve this. Think of an
    array as a block of memory (contiguous) that can hold multiple values of the same type.</p>

  <p>To dynamically allocate an array of data, we put the size we want in <q>square brackets</q>
    after the type (<pf>[size]</pf>). The individual elements will be initialized by the default
    constructor if they are objects or uninitialized if they are primitive values (int, double,
    char, etc...). To initialize an array of primitive values all to 0, we can use an empty
    initializer list after the brackets:</p>

  <listing>
  <program>
    // Allocate an array of 4 integers - uninitialized
    int* data = new int[4];

    // Allocate an array of 1000 integers - initialize to 0
    int* data = new int[1000] {};

    int numPersons = 10;
    // Allocate an array of 10 Person objects - initialized with default constructor
    Person* persons = new Person[numPersons];
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>The first line says something like <q>Allocate enough memory to hold 4 integers and give me a
    pointer to where the data starts.</q>. A memory diagram after running just that line in main
    might look like:</p>

  <image source="images/array-allocation-1.svg"
         >

    <shortdescription>data points at a block of memory that holds four integers. The integers have random values.</shortdescription>

  </image>

  <p>Notice that the pointer <pf>data</pf> is a local variable in <pf>main</pf>'s stack frame. It points to
    the first element of the array, which is stored on the heap. The rest of the elements are stored
    in contiguous memory locations after the first element. All of the values are shown as random
    values because we did not initialize them.</p>

  <p>To free the memory allocated for an array, we use the <pf>delete[]</pf> operator:</p>

  <program>delete[] data;</program>

  <warning>
    <p>The [] is important. It says that we are deleting an array, not just a single value.
      Forgetting the brackets is an error that can lead to undefined behavior (but fortunately,
      AddressSanitizer will catch this).</p>

  <note>
    <p>Arrays can also be allocated on the stack as a local variable. To do that, we don't use <pf>new</pf>
      and we put the size of the array after the variable name:</p>
    <program>int data[1000];</program>
    <p>Arrays placed on the stack have major limitations:
      <ul>
        <li>The size of an array put on the stack must be known at compile time (i.e. a literal number or constant expression). So you can't use
      a variable to declare the size. Trying to write <pf>int data[dataCount]</pf> where <pf>dataCount</pf> is a variable is a
      compile error as the compiler does not know how much space to allocate.</li>
        <li>The total size of all stack variables is limited (often to a few megabytes). Putting a large array on the stack can lead to a stack overflow error.</li>
      </ul>
      In this book we will almost always be using heap allocated arrays.
