  <title>Stack Issues</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The <term>stack</term> enables programmers to not have to worry about memory management for
      local variables and function parameters. When you call a function, space is allocated and when
      it is done, that memory is reclaimed. The programmer doesn't have to worry about where in memory
      each variable should go, it is all handled for them, no matter what series of function calls
      takes place.</p>

    <p>However, there are some significant limitations to the stack.</p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Limited Size</title>

    <p>One limitation is that the stack has a fixed size, which is determined when the program
      starts. If a program uses too much stack memory (for example, by making too many recursive
      function calls), it can cause a <term>stack overflow</term> error. This size is usually
      measured in megabytes. Which means that if you try to put a very large piece of data on the
      stack it can cause a stack overflow.</p>

    <p>Try this program, which tries to allocate a large block of 1,000,000,000 integers. (Don't
      worry about the syntax <pf>int data[1000000000];</pf>, it will be explained soon.)</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="memory-management_stack-issues-program-1"
             interactive="activecode">
  <xi:include href="../../programs/memory-management/stack-issues-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
    </program>
    </listing>

    <p>You should get a <q>segmentation fault</q>. Which is a runtime error indicated you went
      outside a segment of memory (the stack). Each integer takes 4 bytes and <m>1,000,000,000
      \times 4</m> is <m>4,000,000,000</m> bytes, or approximately 4 GB. This exceeds the space
      available. Try reducing the number in the code to 1 million (<pf>1000000</pf>). That should run just
      fine as <m>4,000,000</m> bytes is approximately 4 MB, which the stack has room for.</p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Limited Duration</title>

    <p>Another limitation of the stack is that the lifespan of all local variables and parameters
      are tied to the function call. When a function returns, all of its local variables and
      parameters are destroyed. This means that if you try to return a pointer or reference to a
      local variable, it will point to memory that is no longer valid. This is referred to as <term>undefined
      behavior</term> as there is literally no definition for what should happen in this case.</p>

      <p>The <pf>foo()</pf> function in the sample below gets the address of a local variable <pf>x</pf>. It then prints out that address, and the value at the address. Then it returns the address to main. In main we access that address that was returned:</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="memory-management_stack-issues-program-2"
             interactive="activecode"
             autorun="yes">
<xi:include href="../../programs/memory-management/stack-issues-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
    </program>
    </listing>


    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>When you run the code above, main passes 5 to <pf>foo</pf>, which stores it in <pf>x</pf> and
          then makes a pointer that points at <pf>x</pf>. It returns that address to <pf>main</pf>.</p>
        <p>What is the bad thing that happened?</p>
      </statement>
      <choices>
        <choice>
          <statement>The program crashes with a segmentation fault.</statement>
          <feedback>Incorrect. The memory address stored in <pf>badPointer</pf> is not currently valid, but it
            is in a valid memory segment.</feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement>The program prints a random looking value (that can change with each run).</statement>
          <feedback>Correct, the pointer to <pf>x</pf> is no longer valid in <pf>main</pf>, so accessing
            it results in undefined behavior.</feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>The program runs without any issues.</statement>
          <feedback>Incorrect.</feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>The program fails to build with a compiler error.</statement>
          <feedback>Incorrect.</feedback>
        </choice>
      </choices>
    </activity>

    <p>Now lets try running the same code using codelens:</p>

    <exercise label="memory-management_stack-issues-ex-1">
      <statement>
        <p>Run the code in codelens and answer the question it asks you:</p>
      </statement>
      <program interactive="codelens">
<code>
<xi:include href="../../programs/memory-management/stack-issues-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</code>
    <checkpoint line="7" answer="0xfff000ba4">
      <prompt>What is the local variable <pf>x</pf>s address?</prompt>
    </checkpoint>
    <checkpoint line="7" answer="0xfff000ba4">
      <prompt>What is the local variable <pf>x</pf>s address?</prompt>
    </checkpoint>
      <checkpoint line="10" answer="0xfff000ba4">
        <prompt>What is the address stored in <pf>badPointer</pf>? (Hint: it stores the value returned from <pf>foo</pf>)</prompt>
      </checkpoint>
    </program>
    </exercise>

    <p>The address stored in <pf>badPointer</pf> is shown as a poop emoji (💩) because it holds an address
      that does not currently point at a valid integer. It has the address that WAS used for <pf>x</pf>
      in <pf>foo</pf>. But there is no telling what that address is currently being used for. Rather
      than let you use the pointer, Codelens causes an error when line 17 tries to dereference the
      pointer.</p>

    <p>The critical thing in these examples is that there is no safe way for a function to return a
      memory address for data that was created in its stack frame. All of the memory for the
      function disappears when it returns.</p>

      <note><p>
        If we enable address sanitization, it will flag the issue. We will learn about sanitizers in <xref ref="memory-management_detecting-leaks"/>.
      </p></note>

    <p>If we want to write a function that creates some memory that will be used later on in the
      program, we can not use stack allocation.</p>
