The first step of merge sort is to split the deck into two <q>subdecks</q>, each with about half of the cards.
So we need a method that takes a deck, and a range of indexes, and returns a new deck that contains the specified subset of cards:
</p>

<program>public Deck subdeck(int low, int high) {
    Deck sub = new Deck(high - low + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; sub.cards.length; i++) {
        sub.cards[i] = this.cards[low + i];
    }
    return sub;
}</program>

<p>
The first line creates an unpopulated <c>Deck</c> object that contains an array of <c>null</c> references.
Inside the <c>for</c> loop, the subdeck gets populated with references to <c>Card</c> objects.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>off-by-one</h></idx>
The length of the subdeck is <c>high - low + 1</c>, because both the low card and the high card are included.
This sort of computation can be confusing, and forgetting the <q><c>+ 1</c></q> often leads to <em>off-by-one</em> errors.
Drawing a picture is usually the best way to avoid them.

<xref ref="fig_subdeck">Figure</xref> is a memory diagram of a subdeck with <c>low = 0</c> and <c>high = 4</c>.
The result is a hand with five cards that are <em>shared</em> with the original deck; that is, they are aliased.

Aliasing might not be a good idea, because changes to shared cards would be reflected in multiple decks.
But since <c>Card</c> objects are immutable, this kind of aliasing is not a problem.
And it saves some memory because we don't create duplicate <c>Card</c> objects.
