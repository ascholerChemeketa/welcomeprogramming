  <title>Boolean Values and Variables</title>
  <p>Decisions in programming are generally made based on choices where the only possible answers are either true or false. A program's behavior might depend on "did the user enter the right password?", "is the mouse over this button?", or "is the result less than 0?". All of those are questions that have a true/false (yes/no) answer.</p>

      <h>Boole, George</h>
    </idx> Values that can only be <pf>true</pf> or <pf>false</pf> are known as <q>boolean</q> values, named after the mathematician George Boole who developed an algebraic way of representing true/false logic.</p>
  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>boolean</h>
    </idx> In C++, the <pf>bool</pf> type is used to represent boolean values. You
    can declare and assign them like other variables. In this example, the first line is a variable
    declaration, the second is an assignment, and the third is both: </p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/boolevariables-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>If you try to print a boolean variable, it will display as 1 (true) or 0 (false). In fact, there is a general convention that 0 is <pf>false</pf> and any other value is true. It is syntactically legal to set boolean variables using numeric values, but once you store a number into a <pf>bool</pf> it becomes either 1 or 0:</p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/boolevariables-1b.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
