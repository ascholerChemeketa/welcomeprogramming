  <title>Branches and Scope</title>

  <p>It is important to note that each block has its own scope. That means a local variable declared in a branch is not available outside that branch. For example, here is a broken program to compute someone's pay, possibly including extra pay for overtime (over 40 hours):</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="conditionals-logic_scope-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<code>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/scope.cpp" parse="text"/>
</code>
<stdin>50</stdin>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>Recall that scope is a tool for managing complexity. It allows us to use the same variable name in different parts of a program without worrying about conflicts. We already know that each function has its own scope, but so do different blocks in a function.</p>

  <p>If you try running that program, the compiler will tell you that <pf>pay</pf> is not defined at the end of <pf>main</pf>. That is because when a variable is declared inside a block, it is scoped only for that block. Either <pf>pay</pf> gets created in the <pf>if</pf> and goes out of scope (is no longer available) at the end of the <pf>if</pf>, or it gets created in the <pf>else</pf> and is only available there. To fix the program, we need to declare <pf>pay</pf> before the if/else structure:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="conditionals-logic_scope-program-2" interactive="activecode">
<code>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/scope-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</code>
<stdin>50</stdin>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>Because <pf>pay</pf> was declared in main, and not in the if/else blocks, it is in scope until the end of main. When we enter a block, like the <pf>if</pf> or <pf>else</pf> in this program, all the variables from the outer scope (<pf>main</pf> here) are still available. Changes we make to those variables  will persist when we leave the inner block.</p>

  <insight><p>
  Scope generally matches the conventions for indentation. If you have a block of code that is indented, the variables declared in that block are only available within that block and any blocks inside of it.
  </p>
  </insight>

  <warning><p>It is possible to declare a variable with the same name in an inner block as in an outer block. This is called <term>shadowing</term>. The inner variable will hide the outer variable, but the outer variable is still there. This can be confusing, so it is best to avoid shadowing when possible.

    int x = 10;
    if(x &lt; 100) {
        // This is a "different" x
        int x = 50;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; x;  // still 10
