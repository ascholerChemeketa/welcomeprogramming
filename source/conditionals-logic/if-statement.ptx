      </idx>Now that we have boolean values, we need to use them to control what
      code gets executed. <term>Conditional statements</term> give us this ability. The simplest
      conditional statement in C++ is the <pf>if</pf> statement: </p>

      <p>An if statement consists of <pf>if</pf>, followed by an expression in parentheses, followed by a block of code. The expression is used to determine whether the block of code should be executed.</p>

    <title>The condition</title>
    <p>
      <idx>
        <h>block</h>
      </idx> The expression in parentheses is called the <term>condition</term>
      and must be a variable or expression with a boolean value. If it is true, the statements in
      the curly braces get executed. That group of statements in the braces is known as the <term>
      body</term>. If the condition is false, execution skips over the <term>body</term>.</p>

  </figure>

    <p>Try running this sample in Codelens. Notice that only one of the three conditions is true and
      that the bodies of the other two conditionals get skipped.</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="conditionals-logic_if-statement-program-1"
             interactive="codelens">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-1a.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>


    <p>The <term>condition</term> can be any value that evaluates to <pf>true</pf> or <pf>false</pf>. Because
      numbers can evaluate as true or false (with 0 being false and all other numbers being true),
      that means it is possible, but generally not advisable, to write something like this: </p>

    <program>
    int x = 5;
    if (x) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "x is truish" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  </program>

    <p>It also means that it is legal to use a variable of type <pf>bool</pf> without a comparison, as
      it already has a value of <pf>true</pf> or <pf>false</pf>:</p>

    <listing>
    <program>
    int x = 5;
    bool isEven = (x % 2 == 0);
    if (isEven) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "x is even" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  </program>
    </listing>

    <p>This way of testing a boolean variable is generally preferred to comparing it to true.
      Writing <pf>if (isEven == true)</pf> would do the same thing, but is redundant.</p>

    <idx>
          <h>== equals operator</h>
        </idx>Remember that a single <pf>=</pf> represents
        assignment - it says <q>gets the value</q>. A double equals <pf>==</pf> asks the question <q>is
        equal to?</q>.</p>
        <p>A common mistake is to use a single <pf>=</pf> instead of a double <pf>==</pf>
        when comparing values. If you make this mistake, the compiler will emit a warning like the
        one shown below that tells you you are using an assignment operator in a place where a
        true/false value is expected. </p>
      <console>
        <output>test.cpp:7:10: error: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Werror=parentheses]
    7 |     if( x = 0 ) {
      |          ~^~~</output>
      </console>

  <subsection>
    <title>The body</title>

    <p>The <term>body</term> is the code that gets conditionally. Although above we have shown the body in braces (<pf>{ }</pf>), those are not strictly required if the body is only a single statement:</p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-1b.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>The braces serve to define a <term>block</term> that groups multiple statements into a single one. If we want to have two statements that are both part of the body of the if, they must be made into a block with <pf>{ }</pf>:</p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-1b2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>By convention, we indent the code that is inside a condition, whether or not it is inside
      braces, to clearly show that it is <q>inside</q> the body of the <pf>if</pf>. The compiler does
      not care if you indent or not, but indenting blocks makes code much easier to read.</p>

    <p>Because indentation signals <q>this is inside</q> to programers, but it meaningless to the
      compiler, it can be dangerous to skip braces, even when they are optional. Doing so
      makes it easy to accidentally add a statement to a one-line <pf>if</pf> block.</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="conditionals-logic_if-statement-program-2"
             extra-compiler-args="-Wno-misleading-indentation"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>

    <p>With a modern compiler, you likely will get a warning about that code. But it is possible to silence the warning (like we have here) and run the code anyway.</p>

    <p>Since there are no braces, only the first <pf>cout</pf> is part of the <pf>if</pf> statement. Here
      is a more accurate representation of what the compiler sees:</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="conditionals-logic_if-statement-program-3"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-5.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>

    <p>The indentation in the first version was misleading. The second print statement is not a part
      of the body, and as a result, it runs no matter what. Even experienced programmers make this
      mistake; search the web for Apple's <q>goto fail</q> bug. To avoid this, it is a good idea to
      always use braces, even for one line bodies.</p>

    <p>
      <idx>
        <h>\{\} curly braces</h>
      </idx> In all previous examples, notice that there is no
      semicolon at the end of the line with <pf>if (condition)</pf>. That is because the body is technically part
      of the same statement. This is valid C++:</p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-1c.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>But the strong convention is to write the body on a line by itself. However, it is all still one statement and there should not be a semicolon at the end of the line with the <pf>if</pf> condition. 
      If you put a semicolon after the condition, like this:</p>

    <program label="conditionals-logic_if-statement-program-5">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-7b.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>The compiler sees an <pf>if</pf> statement with no body, followed by a block of code that is not a part
      of the conditional. It sees something more like:</p>

    <program label="conditionals-logic_if-statement-program-5">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-7.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>Again, a modern compiler should offer warnings for this situation. Here, we have left the warnings enabled:</p>

    <listing>
    <program label="conditionals-logic_if-statement-program-4"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ifelse-statement-6.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
    </listing>

<insight><p>Make sure you know how to enable warnings for your compiler. Then pay attention to them! Most warnings are actually errors.</p></insight>
