  <title>Other Conditional Structures</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Although the if/else structure should be your go to tool when you need to make a decision in
      code, there are some other ways to make decisions. This section covers two of those. Neither
      one is necessary - you can write any decision logic just using if/else. But there are special
      situations where these tricks can make code easier to read and write. You should recognize
      them, and should consider using them if they can make your code easier to read/write, but
      reaching for them should likely not be your first instinct.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Switch Statements</title>
    <p> If you need to make a series of decisions, chaining <pf>else if</pf> blocks can get long and
      redundant. For example, consider a program that converts integers like <pf>1</pf>, <pf>2</pf>,
      and <pf>3</pf> into words like <pf>"one"</pf>, <pf>"two"</pf>, and <pf>"three"</pf>: </p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/switch-statement-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>
      <idx>
        <h>switch statement</h>
      </idx>
    <idx>
        <h>statement</h>
        <h>switch</h>
      </idx> This chain could go on and on, with many other cases for. It feels a little silly to keep writing
      <pf>else if (number == ___)</pf>. An
      alternative way to evaluate many possible values of an expression is to use a <pf>switch</pf>
      statement: </p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/switch-statement-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>The body of a <pf>switch</pf> statement is organized into one or more <pf>case</pf> blocks. Each <pf>case</pf>
      ends with a <pf>break</pf> statement, which exits the <pf>switch</pf> body. The <pf>default</pf> block is
      optional and executed only if none of the cases apply.</p>

    <p>If there is no <pf>break</pf>, execution will continue on, ignoring the <pf>case</pf>'s it encounters.
      This is a feature that makes switches particularly useful when multiple cases can be grouped: </p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/switch-statement-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>Any of the values 1-5 will match the appropriate <pf>case</pf> and then <q>fall through</q> the
      others until the <pf>cout</pf> is reached. Then the <pf>break</pf> exits the switch. A similar thing
      happens for 0 or 6 - they <q>fall through</q> to the line that prints that it is a weekend and
      then the <pf>break</pf> exits the switch.</p>

    <p>There are some issues with switch statements that make them less useful than they might
      appear. First: switch statements in C++ can only be used to test integer values. You can not
      use a <pf>double</pf> or a <pf>string</pf> or any other type of data in the test. Second: there is no way
      to switch on a range. You can't say <pf>case &lt; 4:</pf> or <pf>case 5-10:</pf>.</p>
      
      <insight>
      <p>Switch statements are only appropriate if there are a fixed number of discrete values you want to test for.</p>
      <p>They will be very useful once we learn about enumerated types, but for now, they aren't usually going to be the best tool for making decisions.</p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Ternary Conditional Operator</title>

    <p>Consider this somewhat silly example that reads in a number of monkeys and then prints out a
      message. It uses a conditional to pick the right form of monkey (singular or plural):</p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ternary-statement-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>It is awkward to write basically the same code twice just so we can change one word. An
      alternative is to use the <term>ternary conditional operator</term>. This operator is a
      shorthand way to write a simple if/else statement that produces one of two values.</p>
      <p>It is
      called <q>ternary</q> (meaning three) because it has three parts:
      <ul>
        <li>a condition</li>
        <li>a value to return if the condition is true</li>
        <li>a value to return if the condition is false</li>
      </ul>It takes the form <code>
      (TEST ? VALUE1 : VALUE2) </code>. First is the test, followed by a question mark. If the test
      is true, the expression produces <pf>VALUE1</pf>. If it is false, it produces <pf>VALUE2</pf>. (The
      parentheses are not necessary but help to show what is part of ternary operator expression.)
      Here is the monkeys example rewritten to use it:</p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/ternary-statement-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>It is hard to claim that this is a massive improvement. But it is always nice to avoid
      repeating code. The ternary operator can sometimes be useful for doing
      so by making a simple choice between two values in the middle of some other expression. But
      when used with complex expressions it quickly becomes much less readable and much harder to
      debug. So if you choose to use it, make sure to avoid doing so in statements are already
      complex.</p>
