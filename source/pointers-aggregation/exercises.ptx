    <statement>
      <p>This exercises makes use of the Point class created in the previous chapter. See <xref ref="point-final-cxx-listing"/> for the code for it.</p>
      <p>A <pf>Segment</pf> should connect two points (its endpoints). When we make a segment, we will give the constructor the addresses of two Points - we want the segment to use those points as its endpoints. The segment should link to those points, not make copies of them. <pf>(Aggregation)</pf></p>
      <p>
        Finish the Segment class by:
        <ul>
          <li>Adding the member variables <pf>m_p1</pf> and <pf>m_p2</pf> needed to hold the addresses of two Points.</li>
          <li>Make a constructor that accepts two memory addresses to store.</li>
        </ul>

    <statement>
      <p>This exercises makes use of the Point class created in the previous chapter. See <xref ref="point-final-cxx-listing"/> for the code for it.</p>

      <p>This exercises builds on <xref ref="pointers-aggregation_exercises-ex-1"/> - begin by copying your code for the member variables and constructors into this problem.</p>
      <p>
        Then add code for a <pf>shift(int deltaX, int deltaY)</pf> function to <pf>Segment</pf> so that we can shift the segment by some amount in x (deltaX) and some amount in y (deltaY). Moving a segment should move both of its endpoints.

  <exercise label="pointers-aggregation_exercises-ex-3">
    <statement>
      <p>Below is a very simple implementation of a Friend class. In the <pf>TEST_CASE</pf>, add code to create a <pf>Friend f1</pf> named Ronnie, a Friend named Dakota, and a friend named Mary. Make Ronnie Friends with Dakota, Dakota friends with Mary, and Mary friends with Ronnie. Note that friendship is only set in one direction in this program.</p>

  <exercise label="pointers-aggregation_exercises-ex-4">
    <statement>
      <p>Add a <pf>bool bestieCheck()</pf> function to the Friend class. If a Friend's <pf>m_bestFriend</pf> is a null pointer return false. If they have a <pf>m_bestFriend</pf>, check to see if their best friend's <pf>m_bestFriend</pf> is the current object (<pf>this</pf>), if so return true, otherwise return false. In other words, your function returns true if the Friend and their best friend agree that they are best friends. Otherwise it returns false.</p>
