  <title>Objects and <pf>this</pf></title>

  <p>In <xref ref="objects_member-access"/> we learned that within a member function of a class, <pf>this</pf> means the object executing the member function.
     But at that point, we did not delve into what <pf>this</pf> actually is. Now that we have covered pointers, we are ready to do so. <pf>this</pf> is a pointer that is automatically initialized with the memory address of the current object.
  </p>

  <figure align="center">

          width="80%"
          alt="When getX is called on p1, this holds the memory address of p1"/>
  </figure>

  <p>This program demonstrates using <pf>this</pf> inside a member function like <pf>Point::getX()</pf> to get the address of the current object:</p>
  
  <program label="pointers-aggregation_this-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/pointers-aggregation/this-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>
    One way we can use <pf>this</pf> is to explicitly access member variables or functions of the current object.</p>
    
  <p>As an example of that, consider <pf>getX()</pf>. It currently has <pf>return m_x</pf>. The <pf>m_x</pf> in it is understood to mean <q>the m_x of the current object</q>. Writing <pf>this->m_x</pf> explicitly says that is what we want to do:
  </p>

  <program line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="2">
double Point::getX() {
    return this->m_x;
}
  </program>

  <p>If you prefer, you can always use <pf>this-></pf> within member functions to make accessing members explicit. (Though we are already using the <pf>m_</pf> naming convention to clarify which variables are members.) However, keep in mind that <pf>this-></pf> can only be used to access member variables or functions. You can not use it to access local variables or parameters that are not a part of the object. For example, in <pf>setX</pf>, you can use it on <pf>m_x</pf>, but not on the parameter <pf>x</pf>:</p>

  <program line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="4">
Point::setX(double x) {
    this->m_x = x;          // correct, explicit use of this-> to access member
    m_x = x;                // also correct, m_x is implicitly this->m_x
    this->m_x = this->x;    // incorrect, x is not a member of Point
}
  </program>

  <note><p>In some other programming languages, like javascript, <pf>this</pf> is required and every access of a member variable needs to use <pf>this</pf>.</p></note>

  <p>Another use of <pf>this</pf> is to allow an object to return either its address or a reference to itself.</p>

  <program line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="2">
double* Point::getAddress() {
    return this;  // this is the memory address of the current object
}

Point&amp; Point::getReference() {
    return *this;  // return "the thing that this points at"
}
  </program>

  <p>
    The second function is the tricky one. We start with the current object's memory address. We then dereference it with <pf>*this</pf> to get the object itself. The <pf>&amp;</pf> in the return type indicates that we are returning a reference to the object, not a copy of it.</p>

  <p>
    There is a fun (but not essential) trick that is enabled by returning a reference to the current object in a function that otherwise would be void. It can allow method chaining where we write something like <pf>p1.setX(3.0).setY(4.0)</pf>. For example, we could rewrite <pf>setX</pf> and <pf>setY</pf> to return references:
  </p>

  <program line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="1, 3, 6, 8">
  Point&amp; Point::setX(double x) {
      m_x = x;
      return *this;
  }

  Point&amp; Point::setY(double y) {
      m_y = y;
      return *this;
  }
  </program>

  <p>Now, after the call to <pf>setX</pf> does its work, it returns the object that was executing it. So <pf>p1.setX(3.0)</pf> turns into <pf>p1</pf>, which is then used to execute <pf>setY(4.0)</pf>.</p>
