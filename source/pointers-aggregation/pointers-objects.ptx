  <title>Object Member Access with Pointers</title>

  <p> When using pointers with objects, we are likely to encounter a syntax annoyance. Say we have a
    Pointer called <pf>myPointer</pf> that points at a <pf>Point</pf> object and we want to call the <pf>
    getX()</pf> function of that Point. We know that the pointer is just a memory address. To use it
    we need to dereference it - <pf>*myPointer</pf> will give us <q>the object that myPointer points
    at</q>. So we write the following to access the <pf>getX()</pf> of that object (using our <xref ref="point-final-cxx-listing"
          text="title"/>
    ): </p>

  <listing>
    <program label="pointers-aggregation_pointers-objects-program-1"
             interactive="activecode"
             compile-also="point-final-cxx">
<xi:include href="../../programs/pointers-aggregation/pointers-objects-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p> The compiler spits out an error message that looks something like this: </p>

  <console>
    <output>request for member ‘getX’ in ‘myPointer’, which is of pointer type ‘Point*’ (maybe you meant to use ‘->’ ?)</output>
  </console>

  <p>The issue is one of precedence <fn>
      <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence">List of operator
    precedence at cppreference.com</url>
    </fn>. We intended to say, <q>first dereference the
    pointer, then use the getX member of that object</q>. However, <pf>.</pf> is interpreted before <pf>
    *</pf>. So what we said was <q>use the getX member of the pointer (<pf>.</pf>), then dereference
    the result (<pf>*</pf>).</q>. It is as if we had written <pf>*(myPointer.getX())</pf>, which
    does not make sense because <pf>myPointer</pf> is just a memory address, not an object, and thus
    has no <pf>getX()</pf>.</p>

  <insight>
    <p>A pointer is just a memory address, not an object. We can't use it like an object.</p>
  </insight>

  <p>One way to fix this is to use parentheses to make the order of operations clear: </p>

  <program>
    (*myPointer).getX();
  </program>

  <p> That will work as intended (you can try it in the program above). However, it is a bit clunky.
    And it can get really clunky if we have a series of pointers to dereference. Something like the
    statement below is quite hard to quickly read and comprehend:</p>
  <program>(*(*(*cylinderPointer).getBasePointer()).getCenterPointer()).getX();</program>

  <p>C++ provides a shorthand for this situation. Instead of using <pf>*</pf> and <pf>.</pf>
    together, we can use the <term>pointer member access operator</term> <pf>-></pf> (also sometimes
    called the <term>arrow operator</term>. This operator is used to access members of an object
    through a pointer. You can think of <pf>myPointer->getX()</pf> as saying <q>go to the thing
    myPointer points at and then use the getX() member of that object</q>. No parentheses needed! </p>

  <figure>
    <caption>The <pf>-></pf> operator follows a pointer to access the thing it points to and then
      uses the member of that object.</caption>
    <image source="images/pointers-object-member-access.svg"
           width="60%">
      <shortdescription>p points to an object. We can use -> to start from p and access the object's
        member</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>


  <p>So the final correct version of our simple program using the <term>pointer member access
    operator</term> would look like:</p>

             compile-also="point-final-cxx">
<xi:include href="../../programs/pointers-aggregation/pointers-objects-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
    </program>
