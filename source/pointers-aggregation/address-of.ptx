  <title>Memory Addresses of Variables</title>

  <p> One of the benefits of programming in a high-level language like C++ is that we usually do not
    have to worry about the details of how the computer stores our data. We can just declare <pf>int x = 10;</pf>
    and the compiler will do the work of deciding where to place that data into memory and keeping
    track of the location so when we next say <pf>x</pf> the code accesses that same location.
    However, there are times when it is useful to work directly with the memory address of a
    variable - to be able to say <q>work with the data stored at location X</q>. </p>

  <p>In C++, to access the memory address of a variable, we can use the <term>address-of</term>
    operator <pf>&amp;</pf>. To do so, we place it to the left of a variable name. For example, if we
    have a variable <pf>x</pf>, we can get its memory address using <pf>&amp;x</pf>. The example below will
    print the memory address of <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf>:<idx>
      <h>address-of</h>
    </idx><idx>
      <h>&amp; (address-of)</h>
    </idx></p>

           line-numbers="yes">
<xi:include href="../../programs/pointers-aggregation/address-of.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Running the program should produce something like:</p>

  <console>
    <output>
      Address of x: 0x7ffc622069c0
      Address of y: 0x7ffc622069c4
    </output>
  </console>

  <p>The <pf>0x</pf> indicates that these are <url href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/welcomecs2/data-representation_hexadecimal.html?mode=browsing">hexadecimal
    values</url>. The rest of the digits are the actual address. Note that the two values, although
    quite large, are only 4 apart. Since we declared <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf> one after another, and
    in this code, an int takes 4 bytes, the address of y is 4 more than the address of x. If we
    diagrammed the memory at a very low level, it might look like this:</p>

  <figure>
    <caption>Low Level Memory Diagram for x and y</caption>
    <image source="images/pointers-memory-low.svg"
           width="80%"
           >
      <shortdescription>x occupies 4 bytes starting at 0x7ffc622069c0. It stores the binary value for 10. y occupies 4 bytes starting at 0x7ffc622069c4. It stores the binary for 14.</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p> In the diagram, we can see that what we call <pf>x</pf>are the 4 bytes starting at <pf>0x7ffc622069c0</pf>(<pf>0x7ffc622069c0-0x7ffc622069c3</pf>).
    It stores the binary value for 10. What we call <pf>y</pf> are the 4 bytes starting at <pf>0x7ffc622069c4</pf>.
    It stores the binary for 14. Even when we are dealing with memory addresses directly, that
    diagram is more detailed than we actually need. Here is a higher level view of the same memory:</p>

  <figure>
    <caption>Mid Level Memory Diagram for x and y</caption>
    <image source="images/pointers-memory-high.svg"
           width="60%"
           >
      <shortdescription>x is at 0x7ffc622069c0 and has the value 10. y is at 0x7ffc622069c4 and stores 14.</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p> This version focuses on what we actually need to know. It shows us that <pf>x</pf> is at <pf>0x7ffc622069c0</pf>
    and has the value 10. It also shows us that <pf>y</pf> is at <pf>0x7ffc622069c4</pf> and stores 14. We are
    describing it as a mid-level diagram because it includes some of the low level details - the
    memory addresses - but not all of them. A true high-level memory diagram, like we have used in
    the past, would not show us the addresses at all. It would just show us that <pf>x</pf> is 10 and <pf>y</pf>
    is 14. </p>

  <note>
    <p> Unfortunately the <pf>&amp;</pf> symbol can mean multiple things in C++. It can mean: <ul>
        <li>
          <p>That a variable is a reference. It means this when the <pf>&amp;</pf> is placed to the right
      of a type. For example, in the function header <pf>void foo(int &amp;x)</pf>, the <pf>&amp;</pf> means that <pf>x</pf>
      is a reference to an integer. The <pf>&amp;</pf> is modifying the type of <pf>x</pf>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The address-of operator, which gives the memory address of a variable. It means this
      when it is to the left of a variable name and there is no type specification. In other words,
      when we are using a variable, not declaring one, like <pf>cout &lt;&lt; &amp;x;</pf></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Logical or bitwise AND. It means this when it is placed between two variables. For
      example, in the expression <pf>x &amp;&amp; y</pf>, the <pf>&amp;</pf> means to do a bitwise AND operation on the
      values of <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf>. <pf>x amp; y</pf> means to combine the two values bit by bit to
      create a new value (not covered in this book).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
