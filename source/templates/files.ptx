  <title>Using Templated Code Across Files</title>

  <p>If you are using .h/.cpp file pairs to organize your code, there are some special restrictions
    about where you place your templated code. (If you are using modules, there is nothing new to
    consider.) When you are using header/cpp file pairs to organize your code, all of your templated
    code including function definitions should be placed directly into header files.</p>

  <p>This is different than for non-templated code. A regular function will be declared in the .h
    file and defined in the .cpp file. The definition will be compiled as soon as the compiler sees
    it, and we want to make sure that only one instance of the function is created.</p>

  <p>However, templated code is not compiled directly. It instead provides a blueprint for
    generating code. If you try to put the templated code in a separate file (call it <pf>library.cpp</pf>),
    the compiler will do the following: <ul>
      <li>Compile <pf>library.cpp</pf> and see something like <pf>template&lt;typename T> myMax(T a, T b)...</pf> but it won't know what types to build
    versions of that function for.</li>
      <li>Compile <pf>main.cpp</pf> and try to use <pf>myMax</pf> with a specific type like <pf>int</pf>. But since
    the definition is not available, it won't be able to generate the code.</li>
    </ul> In the
    place the template definition is available, the compiler does not know what to build, and in the
    place where it knows what to build, the definition is not available! </p>

    <image source="images/compilation-templates-bad.svg">
      <shortdescription>main.cpp includes library.h and thus only has the template declaration, not
        the definition. library.cpp has the template definition, but does not know what types to
        instantiate.</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p>To resolve this, we need to include the full definition of the templated function or class in
    the header file. That way, in whatever file we try to use the templated code, the compiler will
    have access to the full definition and can generate the appropriate code. To indicate that this
    header file contains templated code, some developers will name this file with a different
    extension, like <pf>.hpp</pf>.</p>

  <figure>
    <caption>Placing all the templated code in the header means the compiler has the needed template
      blueprint when it discovers a use of the template.</caption>
    <image source="images/compilation-templates-good.svg"
           width="60%">
      <shortdescription>main.cpp includes library.hpp and thus has the template definition
        available. There is no library.cpp file.</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p>This means that if you have a library of templated code, you will likely not even need a
    separate .cpp file for implementations as they all should be in the header. Instead of <pf>myTemplatedLibrary.h</pf>
    and <pf>myTemplatedLibrary.cpp</pf> you would likely just have <pf>myTemplatedLibrary.h</pf>.</p>
