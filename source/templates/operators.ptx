  <title>Operations in Templated Code</title>

  <p>Although in theory a templated function can be used with any data type, instantiating the
    template only works if all of the operations used in the function are valid for the data type.</p>

  <p>For example, if we write a templated function that uses the less-than operator (<pf>&lt;</pf>),
    then any data type we want to apply that template to must support the less-than operator. If we
    try to use the function with a type that does not support <pf>&lt;</pf>, we will get a compiler
    error. Consider the following sample that tries to use our <pf>myMax</pf> function on a <pf>Time</pf>
    struct:</p>

  <listing>
    <program label="templates-array-list_operators-1" line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="6, 22"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/templates-array-list/requirements-error.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>The key part of the error message looks like this:</p>

  <console>
    <output>
test.cpp:6:15: error: no match for ‘operator>’ (operand types are ‘Time’ and ‘Time’)
    6 |     return (a > b) ? a : b;
    </output>
  </console>

  <p>When the compiler tries to build a version of <pf>myMax</pf> for the <pf>Time</pf> struct, it looks for
    the <pf>></pf> operator to compare two <pf>Time</pf> objects. Since we haven't defined this operator
    for <pf>Time</pf>, the compiler doesn't know how to compare them and generates an error.</p>

  <p>To fix this, we need to define the <pf>></pf> operator for the <pf>Time</pf> struct:</p>

  <listing>
    <program label="templates-array-list_operators-2"  line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="6,14,26"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/templates-array-list/requirements-fix.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>This requirement is why operator overloading is an important part of C++ programming. By
    defining the <pf>></pf> operator for the <pf>Time</pf> struct, we allow that struct to work in any
    templated code that requires <pf>></pf>.</p>
