  <title>File Input</title>

    <p>In C++ we include the <pf>&lt;fstream></pf> library to work with files. It provides two key types of object: <pf>ifstream</pf> (input file stream) and <pf>ofstream</pf> (output file stream). These objects are used to read from and write to files respectively.</p>


  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>file input</h>
    </idx>To read from a file, we need to create a <pf>std::ifstream</pf> object. (If you are <pf>using namespace std;</pf> you can shorten that to <pf>ifstream</pf>). Like making a string or any other variable, we need to give the stream a name:</p>

    <program>
ifstream inFile;
    </program>

    <p>Once we have a stream object, we need to open a file. This is done with the <pf>open</pf> method of the stream object. The <pf>open</pf> method takes a string as a parameter that is the name of the file we want to open. Once the file is open, we can read from it using the <pf>>></pf> operator just like we were reading from the console.</p>

    <p>This program opens the datafile <pf>Numbers.txt</pf> shown on the previous page and reads the first two numbers from it:</p>

  <program label="input-output_file-input-program-1" add-files="datafile-numbers"  interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/file-input-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

    <exercise label="input-output_file-input-ex-1">
      <statement><p>What happens if you try changing the filename to something else like <pf>"oops.txt"</pf>?</p></statement>

      <choices randomize="yes">
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>An error message is printed and you are asked for a new file name</p>
          </statement>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement>
            <p>All of the numbers show up as 0</p>
          </statement>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>There is an exception</p>
          </statement>
        </choice>
      </choices>
    </exercise>


    <p>The streams provided by <pf>&lt;fstream></pf> are a bit frustrating in that they do not automatically report errors.
      When something bad happens (like trying to open a file that does not exist), the stream simply goes into a failure state and refuses to do anything more.
      In the case of the program above, it never even tries to read in values when we do <pf>inFile >> input;</pf>. The variable just keeps its existing value.</p>
      <p>
    If you want to know if the stream is OK, you have to use one of these checks:</p>

  <listing>
  <program>
// Check if the stream is OK
if (inFile.good()) {
  // stream is OK
}
// Or short version:
if (inFile) {
  // stream is OK
}

// Check for errors
if (inFile.fail()) {
  // stream is NOT OK
}
// Or short version:
if (!inFile) {
  // stream is NOT OK
}
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Here is a version of the program that checks to make sure the file was opened successfully. It also uses a shortened form of creating the <pf>ifstream</pf> and opening a file with it.</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="input-output_file-input-program-2" add-files="datafile-numbers"  interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/file-input-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>Try changing the filename this program is opening to see that it catches the issue. If there is an error, the code returns from main, which ends the program. (Returning a non-zero value is the convention for <q>there was an error in the program</q>). There is no point in trying to read data if we could not open the file!
    We could instead throw an exception, try opening a different file, etc...</p>
