      <pre>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</pre>

      <p>Start by just printing out all of the GPAs. The last two GPAs should be 3 and 3.2. If you see an extra value after those, or two copies of 3.2 at the end, you are probably trying to read one extra line of data and failing. Check for failure after reading the data before you use it.</p>
    </hint>
    <hint>
      <p>You will need to accumulator variables - one to add up the GPAs and the other to keep a count of how many lines you have read.</p>
