  <title>String Streams</title>

  <p>One final kind of stream is worth discussion: the <pf>stringstream</pf>. This is a stream that reads from or writes to a string. It can be used as an alternative to <pf>std::format</pf> for building up a string with data from variables. It also can be used to imitate writing to a file. If we want to test out code that is supposed to write to a file, we can instead have it write to a <pf>stringstream</pf> and then print out the string that was produced. If the output looks good, we know that if we successfully open a file and write to that instead of the <pf>stringstream</pf>, our program should work correctly.</p>

  <p>The <pf>stringstream</pf> data type is defined in the <pf>&lt;sstream></pf> library. Once we create a variable of type <pf>stringstream</pf> we can then immediately write to it using <pf>&lt;&lt;</pf> (there is no file to open). Once we are done writing, we can use the <pf>.str()</pf> method to ask the string stream for the string that was built up:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="input-output_string-streams-program-1"  interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="2,7,16">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/string-streams-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>It is also possible to read from a string stream. This is done by using the <pf>.str()</pf> method to set the string that we want to read from. Once we have set the string, we can use <pf>>></pf> to read from it just like we would from a file or the console:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="input-output_string-streams-program-2"  interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="2,10, 12, 15, 17-18">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/string-streams-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>Notice that once we are done setting up the stringstream, all the rest of the code looks just like reading from a file. We even still use <pf>eof()</pf> even though there isn't really a file that we are reading from. This is the advantage of using the <q>stream</q> abstraction<mdash/>we can use one set of tools to read from the console, a file, or a stringstream all in the same way.</p>
