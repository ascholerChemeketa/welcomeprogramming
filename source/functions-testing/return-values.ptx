  <title>More on Returning</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>We have already learned the basics of returning from functions. But there are a few important
      details we still need to cover.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Returning Variables</title>

    <p>As we have already mentioned, The type of the expression in the <pf>return</pf> statement must
      match the return type of the function itself. When you declare that the return type is <pf>double</pf>,
      you are making a promise that this function will eventually produce a <pf>double</pf> value. If you
      try to <pf>return</pf> with no expression, or <pf>return</pf> an expression with the wrong type, the
      compiler will give an error.</p>

    <p>Although it is possible to return a literal value with something like <pf>return 42;</pf>, it is much
      more common to want to return the result of a computation. We can either do so by returning an
      expression: </p>

    <program highlight-lines="2"
             line-numbers="yes">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/return-values-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>Or by returning a local variable:</p>

    <program highlight-lines="2-3"
             line-numbers="yes">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/return-values-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>Much like when we pass a variable to a function, when we return a variable, the value of the
      variable is copied as it is returned. So although we might say of the function above <q>it
      returns <pf>area</pf></q>, it is more accurate to say <q>it returns the value stored in <pf>area</pf></q>
      .</p>

    <p>The two approaches will produce the same result, but the second is often easier to read and
      debug. Especially when you are stepping through code, first calculating an answer and storing
      it into a variable, then returning the value of that variable, makes it easier to see what is
      going on. </p>

    <note>
      <p>It is also worth mentioning that the two approaches will almost certainly produce the same
        object code when a compiler gets done optimizing the code.</p>
      <p>Trying to <q>optimize</q> code by using fewer local variables is almost always pointless.
        Focus on code that is easy to read and debug. The compiler can generally be counted on to
        turn your code into an efficient machine representation. There are times when programmers
        will write code in a specific way to optimize its speed, but you should not try to <q>
        optimize</q> your use of local variables.</p>

    <title>Void Functions</title>
    <p>
      <idx>
        <h>void</h>
      </idx> Every function must specify a return type in its prototype. But not
      every function needs to return a value. Some functions are used for their <pf>side effects</pf> - they do
      something, but they don't produce a value. A function might print something to the screen, or
      play a sound or send a message over the network.</p>
    <p> These functions have a return type of <pf>void</pf> (<q>void</q> as in nothing) and don't need a <pf>return</pf>
      statement: </p>

    <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/return-values-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

    <p>If you want to provide a return statement, you can simply return nothing when the function is
      done with <pf>return;</pf></p>

    <p>Because <pf>void</pf> functions do not return anything, there is no need to try to store their
      result. In fact, any attempt to use their result would be an error. If we wrote <pf>double result = printAsMoney(12.432345);</pf>, we
      are essentially saying <pf>double result =   ;</pf> because <pf>printAsMoney(12.432345)</pf> evaluates to nothing.</p>

    <p>Here is a full program that uses the void function:</p>

    <program label="functions-testing_return-values-program-1"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/return-values-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
