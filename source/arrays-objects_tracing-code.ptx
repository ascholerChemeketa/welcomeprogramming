To see how binary search works, it's helpful to add the following print statement at the beginning of the loop:
</p>

<program>System.out.println(low + ", " + high);</program>

<p>
Using a sorted deck of cards, we can search for the Jack of Clubs like this:
</p>

<program>Card card = new Card(11, 0);
System.out.println(binarySearch(cards, card));</program>

<p>
We expect to find this card at position 10 (since the Ace of Clubs is at position 0).
Here is the output of <c>binarySearch</c>:
</p>

<console>
<output>
0, 51
0, 24
0, 11
6, 11
9, 11
10
</output>
</console>

<p>
You can see the range of cards shrinking as the <c>while</c> loop runs, until eventually index 10 is found.
If we search for a card that's not in the array<mdash/>like <c>new Card(15, 1)</c>, or the 15 of Diamonds<mdash/>we get the following:
</p>

<console>
<output>
0, 51
26, 51
26, 37
26, 30
26, 27
-1
</output>
</console>

<p>
Each time through the loop, we cut the distance between <c>low</c> and <c>high</c> in half.
After <m>k</m> iterations, the number of remaining cards is <m>52 / 2^k</m>.
To find the number of iterations it takes to complete, we set <m>52 / 2^k = 1</m> and solve for <m>k</m>.
The result is <m>\log_2 52</m>, which is about 5.7.
So we might have to look at 5 or 6 cards, as opposed to all 52 if we did a sequential search.
</p>

<p>
More generally, if the array contains <m>n</m> elements, binary search requires <m>\log_2 n</m> comparisons, and sequential search requires <m>n</m>.
For large values of <m>n</m>, binary search is substantially faster.
