<title>Building a Histogram</title>

<idx><h>histogram</h></idx>
<idx><h>counter</h></idx>
If these values were exam scores<mdash/>and they would be pretty bad exam scores in that case<mdash/>the teacher might present them to the class in the form of a <em>histogram</em>.
In statistics, a histogram is a set of counters that keeps track of the number of times each value appears.
</p>

<p>
For exam scores, we might have 10 counters to keep track of how many students scored in the 90s, the 80s, etc.
To do that, we can traverse the array and count the number of elements that fall in a given range.
</p>

<p>
The following method takes an array and two integers.
It returns the number of elements that fall in the range from <c>low</c> to <c>high - 1</c>:
</p>

<program>
public static int inRange(int[] a, int low, int high) {
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {
if (a[i] >= low &amp;&amp; a[i] &lt; high) {
count++;
}
}
return count;
}
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>reduce</h></idx>
This pattern should look familiar: it is another reduce operation.
Notice that <c>low</c> is included in the range (<c>>=</c>), but <c>high</c> is excluded (&lt;).
This design keeps us from counting any scores twice.
</p>

<p>
Now we can count the number of scores in each grade range.
We add the following code to our \java{main} method:
</p>

<program>
int[] scores = randomArray(30);
int a = inRange(scores, 90, 100);
int b = inRange(scores, 80, 90);
int c = inRange(scores, 70, 80);
int d = inRange(scores, 60, 70);
int f = inRange(scores, 0, 60);
</program>

<p>
This code is repetitive, but it is acceptable as long as the number of ranges is small.
Suppose we wanted to keep track of the number of times each individual score appears.
Then we would have to write 100 lines of code:
</p>

<program>
int count0 = inRange(scores, 0, 1);
int count1 = inRange(scores, 1, 2);
int count2 = inRange(scores, 2, 3);
...
int count99 = inRange(scores, 99, 100);
</program>

<p>
What we need is a way to store 100 counters, preferably so we can use an index to access them.
Wait a minute<mdash/>that's exactly what an array does.
</p>

<p>
The following fragment creates an array of 100 counters, one for each possible score.
It loops through the scores and uses \java{inRange} to count how many times each score appears.
Then it stores the results in the \java{counts} array:
</p>

<program>
int[] counts = new int[100];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; counts.length; i++) {
counts[i] = inRange(scores, i, i + 1);
}
</program>

<p>
Notice that we are using the loop variable \java{i} three times: as an index into the \java{counts} array, and in the last two arguments of \java{inRange}.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>efficiency</h></idx>
The code works, but it is not as efficient as it could be.
Every time the loop invokes \java{inRange}, it traverses the entire array.
It would be better to make a single pass through the \java{scores} array.
</p>

<p>
For each score, we already know which range it falls in<mdash/>the score itself.
We can use that value to increment the corresponding counter.
This code traverses the array of scores <em>only once</em> to generate the histogram:
</p>

<program>
int[] counts = new int[100];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; scores.length; i++) {
int index = scores[i];
counts[index]++;
}
</program>

<p>
Each time through the loop, it selects one element from \java{scores} and uses it as an index to increment the corresponding element of \java{counts}.
Because this code traverses the array of scores only once, it is much more efficient.
