The code for this chapter is in the <em>ch04</em> directory of <em>ThinkJavaCode2</em>.
See <xref ref="code">page</xref> for instructions on how to download the repository.
Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.

If you have not already read <xref ref="cltesting">Appendix</xref>, now might be a good time.
It describes an efficient way to test programs that take input from the user and display specific output.

The purpose of this exercise is to take code from a previous exercise and redesign it as a method that takes parameters.
Start with a working solution to <xref ref="ex_date">Exercise</xref>.
<ol>
<li><p>Write a method called <c>printAmerican</c> that takes the day, date, month, and year as parameters and displays them in American format.</p></li>
<li><p>Test your method by invoking it from <c>main</c> and passing appropriate arguments.
The output should look something like this (except the date might be different):

\begin{stdout}
Monday, July 22, 2019
\end{stdout}</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have debugged <c>printAmerican</c>, write another method called <c>printEuropean</c> that displays the date in European format.</p></li>
</ol>

This exercise reviews the flow of execution through a program with multiple methods.
Read the following code and answer the questions:
</p>

<program>
public static void main(String[] args) {
zippo("rattle", 13);
}
</program>

<program>
public static void baffle(String blimp) {
System.out.println(blimp);
zippo("ping", -5);
}
</program>

<program>
public static void zippo(String quince, int flag) {
if (flag &lt; 0) {
System.out.println(quince + " zoop");
} else {
System.out.println("ik");
baffle(quince);
System.out.println("boo-wa-ha-ha");
}
}
</program>

<p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write the number 1 next to the first line of code in this program that will execute.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the number 2 next to the second line of code, and so on until the end of the program.
If a line is executed more than once, it might end up with more than one number next to it.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of the parameter <c>blimp</c> when <c>baffle</c> gets invoked?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the output of this program?</p></li>

Answer the following questions without running the program on a computer.
<ol>
<li><p>Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time <c>ping</c> is invoked.</p></li>
<li><p>What is output by the following program?
Be precise about the placement of spaces and newlines.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<program>
public static void zoop() {
baffle();
System.out.print("You wugga ");
baffle();
}
</program>

<program>
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("No, I ");
zoop();
System.out.print("I ");
baffle();
}
</program>

<program>
public static void baffle() {
System.out.print("wug");
ping();
}
</program>

<program>
public static void ping() {
System.out.println(".");
}
</program>
</statement>

If you have a question about whether something is legal, and what happens if it is not, a good way to find out is to ask the compiler.
Answer the following questions by trying them out.
<ol>
<li><p>What happens if you invoke a value method and don't do anything with the result; that is, if you don't assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens if you use a void method as part of an expression?
For example, try <c>System.out.println("boo!") + 7;</c>.</p></li>
</ol>

Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the <em>second</em> time <c>zoop</c> is invoked.
What is the complete output?
</p>

<program>
public static void zoop(String fred, int bob) {
System.out.println(fred);
if (bob == 5) {
ping("not ");
} else {
System.out.println("!");
}
}
</program>

<program>
public static void main(String[] args) {
int bizz = 5;
int buzz = 2;
zoop("just for", bizz);
clink(2 * buzz);
}
</program>

<program>
public static void clink(int fork) {
System.out.print("It's ");
zoop("breakfast ", fork);
}
</program>

<program>
public static void ping(String strangStrung) {
System.out.println("any " + strangStrung + "more ");
}
</program>
</statement>

Many computations can be expressed more concisely using the <q>multadd</q> operation, which takes three operands and computes <c>a * b + c</c>.
Some processors even provide a hardware implementation of this operation for floating-point numbers.
<ol>
<li><p>Create a new program called <em>Multadd.java</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a method called <c>multadd</c> that takes three <c>doubles</c> as parameters and returns <c>a * b + c</c>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a <c>main</c> method that tests <c>multadd</c> by invoking it with a few simple parameters, like <c>1.0, 2.0, 3.0</c>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also in <c>main</c>, use <c>multadd</c> to compute the following values:
<md>
  <mrow>  \amp  \sin \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\cos \frac{\pi}{4}}{2} \amp</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  \log 10 + \log 20 \amp</mrow>
</md></p></li>
<li><p>Write a method called <c>expSum</c> that takes a double as a parameter and uses <c>multadd</c> to calculate:
<md>
  <mrow>  x e^{-x} + \sqrt{1 - e^{-x}}</mrow>
</md>
<em>Hint:</em> The method for raising <m>e</m> to a power is <c>Math.exp</c>.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In the last part of this exercise, you need to write a method that invokes another method you wrote.
Whenever you do that, it is a good idea to test the first method carefully before working on the second.
Otherwise, you might find yourself debugging two methods at the same time, which can be difficult.
</p>

<p>
One of the purposes of this exercise is to practice pattern-matching: the ability to recognize a specific problem as an instance of a general category of problems.
