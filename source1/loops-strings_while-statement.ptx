Using a <c>while</c> statement, we can repeat the same code multiple times:
</p>

<program>
int n = 3;
while (n > 0) {
System.out.println(n);
n = n - 1;
}
System.out.println("Blastoff!");
</program>

<p>
Reading the code in English sounds like this: <q>Start with <c>n</c> set to 3.
While <c>n</c> is greater than 0, print the value of <c>n</c>, and reduce the value of <c>n</c> by 1.
When you get to 0, print Blastoff!</q>
</p>

<p>
The output is shown here:
</p>

<console>
<output>
3
2
1
Blastoff!
</output>
</console>

<p>
The flow of execution for a <c>while</c> statement is as follows:
<ol>
<li><p>Evaluate the condition in parentheses, yielding <c>true</c> or <c>false</c>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the condition is <c>false</c>, skip the following statements in braces.</p></li>
<li><p>If the condition is <c>true</c>, execute the statements and go back to step 1.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>loop</h></idx>
This type of flow is called a <em>loop</em>, because the last step <q>loops back around</q> to the first.
<xref ref="fig_while">Figure</xref> shows this idea using a flowchart.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>loop body</h></idx>
<idx><h>infinite loop</h></idx>
<idx><h>loop</h><h>infinite</h></idx>
The <em>body</em> of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that, eventually, the condition becomes <c>false</c> and the loop terminates.
Otherwise, the loop will repeat forever, which is called an <em>infinite loop</em>:
</p>

<program>
int n = 3;
while (n > 0) {
System.out.println(n);
// n never changes
}
</program>

<p>
This example will print the number <c>3</c> forever, or at least until you terminate the program.
An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, <q>Lather, rinse, repeat,</q> are an infinite loop.
</p>

<p>
In the first example, we can prove that the loop terminates when <c>n</c> is positive.
But in general, it is not so easy to tell whether a loop terminates.
For example, this loop continues until <c>n</c> is 1 (which makes the condition <c>false</c>):
</p>

<program>
while (n != 1) {
System.out.println(n);
if (n
n = n / 2;
} else { // n is odd
n = 3 * n + 1;
}
}
</program>

<p>
Each time through the loop, the program displays the value of <c>n</c> and then checks whether it is even or odd.
If it is even, the value of <c>n</c> is divided by 2.
If it is odd, the value is replaced by <m>3n+1</m>.
For example, if the starting value is 3, the resulting sequence is 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
</p>

<p>
Since <c>n</c> sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof that <c>n</c> will ever reach 1 and that the program will ever terminate.
For some values of <c>n</c>, such as the powers of two, we can prove that it terminates.
The previous example ends with such a sequence, starting when <c>n</c> is 16 (or <m>2^4</m>).
</p>

<p>
The hard question is whether this program terminates for <em>all</em> values of <c>n</c>.
So far, no one has been able to prove it <em>or</em> disprove it!
