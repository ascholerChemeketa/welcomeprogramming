<title>DrJava Interactions</title>
<p>
One of the most useful features of DrJava is the <q>Interactions</q> pane at the bottom of the window.
It provides the ability to try out code quickly, without having to write a class definition and save/compile/run the program.
<xref ref="fig_drjava2">Figure</xref> shows an example.

<p>
There is one subtle detail to note when using the Interactions pane.
If you don't end an expression (or statement) with a semicolon, DrJava automatically displays its value.
Notice in <xref ref="fig_drjava2">Figure</xref> that the variable declarations end with semicolons, but the logic expressions in the following lines do not.
This feature saves you from having to type <c>System.out.println</c> every time.
</p>

<p>
What's nice about this feature is that you don't have to create a new class, declare a <c>main</c> method, write arbitrary expressions inside <c>System.out.println</c> statements, save the source file, and get all of your code to compile in advance.
Also, you can press the up/down arrows on the keyboard to repeat previous commands and experiment with incremental differences.
