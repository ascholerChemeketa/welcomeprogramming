<title>Counting Up Recursively</title>
<p>
The <c>countdown</c> example in <xref ref="recursion">Section</xref> has three parts: (1) it checks the base case, (2) it displays something, and (3) it makes a recursive call.
What do you think happens if you reverse steps 2 and 3, making the recursive call <em>before</em> displaying?
</p>

<program>
public static void countup(int n) {
if (n == 0) {
System.out.println("Blastoff!");
} else {
countup(n - 1);
System.out.println(n);
}
}
</program>

<p>
The stack diagram is the same as before, and the method is still called <m>n</m> times.
But now the <c>System.out.println</c> happens just before each recursive call returns.
As a result, it counts <em>up</em> instead of down:
</p>

<console>
<output>
Blastoff!
1
2
3
</output>
</console>

<p>
Keep this in mind for the next example, which displays numbers in binary.
