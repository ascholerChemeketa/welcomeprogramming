<title>The switch Statement</title>
<p>
If you need to make a series of decisions, chaining <c>else if</c> blocks can get long and redundant.
For example, consider a program that converts integers like <c>1</c>, <c>2</c>, and <c>3</c> into words like <c>"one"</c>, <c>"two"</c>, and <c>"three"</c>:
</p>

<program>
if (number == 1) {
word = "one";
} else if (number == 2) {
word = "two";
} else if (number == 3) {
word = "three";
} else {
word = "unknown";
}
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>switch statement</h></idx>
<idx><h>statement</h><h>switch</h></idx>
This chain could go on and on, especially for banking programs that write numbers in long form (e.g., <q>one hundred twenty-three and 45/100 dollars</q>).
An alternative way to evaluate many possible values of an expression is to use a <c>switch</c> statement:
</p>

<program>
switch (number) {
case 1:
word = "one";
break;
case 2:
word = "two";
break;
case 3:
word = "three";
break;
default:
word = "unknown";
break;
}
</program>

<p>
The body of a <c>switch</c> statement is organized into one or more <c>case</c> blocks.
Each <c>case</c> ends with a <c>break</c> statement, which exits the <c>switch</c> body.
The <c>default</c> block is optional and executed only if none of the cases apply.
</p>

<p>
Although <c>switch</c> statements appear longer than chained <c>else if</c> blocks, they are particularly useful when multiple cases can be grouped:
</p>

<program>
switch (food) {
case "apple":
case "banana":
case "cherry":
System.out.println("Fruit!");
break;
case "asparagus":
case "broccoli":
case "carrot":
System.out.println("Vegetable!");
break;
}
</program>
