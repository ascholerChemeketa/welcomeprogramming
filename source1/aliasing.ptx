Remember that when you assign an object to a variable, you are assigning a <em>reference</em> to an object.
It is possible to have multiple variables that refer to the same object.
For example, this code creates two variables that refer to the same <c>Rectangle</c>:
</p>

<program>
Rectangle box1 = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 200);
Rectangle box2 = box1;
</program>

<p>
<xref ref="fig_aliasing">Figure</xref> shows the result: <c>box1</c> and <c>box2</c> refer to the same object, so any changes that affect one variable also affect the other.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_aliasing" >
<caption>Memory diagram showing two variables that refer to the same <c>Rectangle</c> object.</caption>

</figure>
<p>
For example, the following code uses <c>grow</c> to make <c>box1</c> bigger by 50 units in all directions.
It decreases <c>x</c> and <c>y</c> by 50, and it increases <c>height</c> and <c>width</c> by 100:
</p>

<program>
box1.grow(50, 50); // grow box1 (alias)
</program>

<p>
The result is shown in <xref ref="fig_aliasing2">Figure</xref>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_aliasing2" >
<caption>Memory diagram showing the effect of invoking <c>grow</c>.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/aliasing2.png" />
</figure>
<p>
Now, if we print <c>box1</c>, we are not surprised to see that it has changed:
</p>

<program>
java.awt.Rectangle[x=-50,y=-50,width=200,height=300]
</program>

<p>
And if we print <c>box2</c>, we should not be surprised to see that it has changed too, because it refers to the same object:
</p>

<program>
java.awt.Rectangle[x=-50,y=-50,width=200,height=300]
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>aliasing</h></idx>
This scenario is called <q>aliasing</q> because a single object has multiple names, or aliases, that refer to it.
</p>

<p>
As you can tell from this simple example, code that involves aliasing can get confusing fast, and it can be difficult to debug.
