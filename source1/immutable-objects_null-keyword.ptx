<title>The null Keyword</title>
<p>
Often when you declare an object variable, you assign it to reference an object.
But sometimes you want to declare a variable that doesn't refer to an object, at least initially.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>null</h></idx>
In Java, the keyword <c>null</c> is a special value that means <q>no object</q>.
You can initialize object and array variables this way:
</p>

<program>
String name = null;
int[] combo = null;
</program>

<p>
The value <c>null</c> is represented in memory diagrams by a small box with no arrow, as in <xref ref="fig_mem4">Figure</xref>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_mem4" >
<caption>Memory diagram showing variables that are <c>null</c>.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/mem4.png" />
</figure>
<p>
<idx><h>NullPointerException</h></idx>
<idx><h>exception</h><h>NullPointer</h></idx>
If you try to use a variable that is <c>null</c> by invoking a method or accessing an element, Java throws a <c>NullPointerException</c>:
</p>

<program>
System.out.println(name.length()); // NullPointerException
System.out.println(combo[0]); // NullPointerException
</program>

<p>
On the other hand, it is perfectly fine to pass a <c>null</c> reference as an argument to a method, or to receive one as a return value.
In these situations, <c>null</c> is often used to represent a special condition or indicate an error.
