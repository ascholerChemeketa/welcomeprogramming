<title>Example Source File</title>
<p>
Now let's take a look at a more complete example.
The code for this section is in the <em>appb</em> directory of <em>ThinkJavaCode2</em>.
See <xref ref="code">page</xref> for instructions on how to download the repository.

<p>
Professional-grade source files often begin with a copyright statement.
This text spans multiple lines, but it is not part of the documentation.
So we use a multiline comment (<c>/*</c>) rather than a documentation comment (<c>/**</c>).
Our example source file, <em>Convert.java</em>, includes the MIT License (\url{https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT}):

Import statements generally follow the copyright text.
After that, we can define the class itself and begin writing the documentation (<c>/**</c>):
</p>

<program>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
* Methods for converting to/from the metric system.
*
* @author Allen Downey
* @author Chris Mayfield
* @version 6.1.5
*/
public class Convert {
</program>

<p>
A common mistake that beginners make is to put <c>import</c> statements between the documentation and the <c>public class</c> line.
Doing so separates the documentation from the class itself.
To avoid this issue, always make the end of the comment (the \relax<c>*/</c>) <q>touch</q> the word <c>public</c>.
</p>

<p>
This class has two constants and three methods.
The constants are self-explanatory, so there is no need to write documentation for them:
</p>

<program>
public static final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;

public static final int IN_PER_FOOT = 12;
</program>

<p>
The methods, on the other hand, could use some explanation.
Each documentation comment includes a description, followed by a blank line, followed by a <c>@param</c> tag for each parameter, followed by a <c>@return</c> tag:
</p>

<program>
/**
* Converts a measurement in centimeters to inches.
*
* @param cm length in centimeters
* @return length in inches
*/
public static double toImperial(double cm) {
return cm / CM_PER_INCH;
}
</program>

<program>
/**
* Converts a length in feet and inches to centimeters.
*
* @param feet how many feet
* @param inches how many inches
* @return length in centimeters
*/
public static double toMetric(int feet, int inches) {
int total = feet * IN_PER_FOOT + inches;
return total * CM_PER_INCH;
}
</program>

<p>
The <c>main</c> method has a similar documentation comment, except there is no <c>@return</c> tag since the method is <c>void</c>:
</p>

<program>
/**
* Tests the conversion methods.
*
* @param args command-line arguments
*/
public static void main(String[] args) {
double cm, result;
int feet, inches;
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

// test the Imperial conversion
System.out.print("Exactly how many cm? ");
cm = in.nextDouble();
result = toImperial(cm);
System.out.printf("That's
System.out.println();

// test the Metric conversion
System.out.print("Now how many feet? ");
feet = in.nextInt();
System.out.print("And how many inches? ");
inches = in.nextInt();
result = toMetric(feet, inches);
System.out.printf("That's
}
</program>

<p>
Here are two ways you can run the Javadoc tool on this example program:
<ul>
<idx><h>command-line interface</h></idx>
<li><p>From the command line, go to the location for <em>Convert.java</em>.
The <c>-d</c> option of <c>javadoc</c> indicates where to generate the HTML files:

\begin{stdout}
javadoc -d doc Convert.java
\end{stdout}</p></li>
<li><p>From DrJava, click the <em>Javadoc</em> button on the toolbar.
The IDE will then prompt you for a location to generate the HTML files.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For more examples of what you can do with Javadoc comments, see the source code of any Java library class (e.g., <em>Scanner.java</em>).
<xref ref="src_zip">Section</xref> explains how to find the source files for the Java library on your computer.
