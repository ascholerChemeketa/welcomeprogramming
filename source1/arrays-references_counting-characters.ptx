<title>Counting Characters</title>
<p>
We now return to the example from the beginning of the chapter and present a solution to <xref ref="doubloon">Exercise</xref> using arrays.
Here is the problem again:
</p>
<blockquote>
A word is said to be a <q>doubloon</q> if every letter that appears in the word appears exactly twice.
Write a method called <c>isDoubloon</c> that takes a string and checks whether it is a doubloon.
To ignore case, invoke the <c>toLowerCase</c> method before checking.
</blockquote>
<p>
Based on the approach from <xref ref="singlepass">Section</xref>, we will create an array of 26 integers to count how many times each letter appears.
We convert the string to lowercase, so that we can treat <c>'A'</c> and <c>'a'</c> (for example) as the same letter.
</p>

<program>
int[] counts = new int[26];
String lower = s.toLowerCase();
</program>

<p>
We can use a <c>for</c> loop to iterate each character in the string.
To update the <c>counts</c> array, we need to compute the index that corresponds to each character.
Fortunately, Java allows you to perform arithmetic on characters:
</p>

<program>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; lower.length(); i++) {
char letter = lower.charAt(i);
int index = letter - 'a';
counts[index]++;
}
</program>

<p>
If <c>letter</c> is <c>'a'</c>, the value of <c>index</c> is <c>0</c>;
if <c>letter</c> is <c>'b'</c>, the value of <c>index</c> is <c>1</c>,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
Then we use <c>index</c> to increment the corresponding element of <c>counts</c>.
At the end of the loop, <c>counts</c> contains a histogram of the letters in the string <c>lower</c>.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>toCharArray</h></idx>
We can simplify this code with an enhanced <c>for</c> loop, but it doesn't work with strings; we have to convert <c>lower</c> to an array of characters, like this:
</p>

<program>
for (char letter : lower.toCharArray()) {
int index = letter - 'a';
counts[index]++;
}
</program>

<p>
Once we have the counts, we can use a second <c>for</c> loop to check whether each letter appears zero or two times:
</p>

<program>
for (int count : counts) {
if (count != 0 &amp;&amp; count != 2) {
return false; // not a doubloon
}
}
return true; // is a doubloon
</program>

<p>
If we find a count that is neither 0 or 2, we know the word is not a doubloon and we can return immediately.
If we make it all the way through the <c>for</c> loop, we know that all counts are 0 or 2, which means the word is a doubloon.
</p>

<p>
Pulling together the code fragments, and adding some comments and test cases, here's the entire program:
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>Doubloon.java</h></idx>
</p>

<listing filename="Doubloon.java">
<program interactive="activecode">
public class Doubloon {

public static boolean isDoubloon(String s) {
// count the number of times each letter appears
int[] counts = new int[26];
String lower = s.toLowerCase();
for (char letter : lower.toCharArray()) {
int index = letter - 'a';
counts[index]++;
}
// determine whether the given word is a doubloon
for (int count : counts) {
if (count != 0 &amp;&amp; count != 2) {
return false;
}
}
return true;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(isDoubloon("Mama")); // true
System.out.println(isDoubloon("Lama")); // false
}
}
</program>
</listing>

<p>
This example uses methods, <c>if</c> statements, <c>for</c> loops, arithmetic and logical operators, integers, characters, strings, booleans, and arrays.
We hope you'll take a second to appreciate how much you've learned!
