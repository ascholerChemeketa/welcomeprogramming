One challenge of programming, especially for beginners, is figuring out how to divide a program into methods.
In this section, we present a <em>design process</em> that allows you to divide a program into methods as you go along.
The process is called <q>encapsulation and generalization</q>.
The essential steps are as follows:
<ol>
<li><p>Write a few lines of code in <c>main</c> or another method, and test them.</p></li>
<li><p>When they are working, wrap them in a new method and test again.</p></li>
<li><p>If it's appropriate, replace literal values with variables and parameters.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>table</h><h>two-dimensional</h></idx>
To demonstrate this process, we'll develop methods that display multiplication tables.
We begin by writing and testing a few lines of code.
Here is a loop that displays the multiples of two, all on one line:
</p>

<program>
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 6; i++) {
System.out.printf("
}
System.out.println();
</program>

<p>
Each time through the loop, we display the value of <c>2 * i</c>, padded with spaces so it's four characters wide.
Since we use <c>System.out.printf</c>, the output appears on a single line.
</p>

<p>
After the loop, we call <c>println</c> to print a newline character.
Remember that in some environments, none of the output is displayed until the line is complete.
The output of the code so far is shown here:
</p>

<console>
<output>
2 4 6 8 10 12
</output>
</console>

<p>
<idx><h>encapsulate</h></idx>
The next step is to <em>encapsulate</em> the code; that is, we <q>wrap</q> the code in a method:
</p>

<program>
public static void printRow() {
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 6; i++) {
System.out.printf("
}
System.out.println();
}
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>generalize</h></idx>
Finally, we <em>generalize</em> the method to print multiples of other numbers by replacing the constant value <c>2</c> with a parameter <c>n</c>.
This step is called <q>generalization</q>, because it makes the method more general (less specific):
</p>

<program>
public static void printRow(int n) {
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 6; i++) {
System.out.printf("
}
System.out.println();
}
</program>

<p>
Invoking this method with the argument <c>2</c> yields the same output as before.
With the argument <c>3</c>, the output is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
3 6 9 12 15 18
</output>
</console>

<p>
By now, you can probably guess how we are going to display a multiplication table: we'll invoke <c>printRow</c> repeatedly with different arguments.
In fact, we'll use another loop to iterate through the rows:
</p>

<program>
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 6; i++) {
printRow(i);
}
</program>

<p>
And the output looks like this:
</p>

<console>
<output>
1 2 3 4 5 6
2 4 6 8 10 12
3 6 9 12 15 18
4 8 12 16 20 24
5 10 15 20 25 30
6 12 18 24 30 36
</output>
</console>
