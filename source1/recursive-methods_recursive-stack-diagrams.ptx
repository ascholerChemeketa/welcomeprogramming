In <xref ref="stack">Section</xref>, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a method invocation.
The same kind of diagram can make it easier to interpret a recursive method.
</p>

<p>
Remember that every time a method gets called, Java creates a new frame that contains the method's parameters and variables.
<xref ref="fig_stack2">Figure</xref> is a stack diagram for <c>countdown</c>, called with <c>n == 3</c>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_stack2" >
<caption>Stack diagram for the <c>countdown</c> program.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/stack2.png" />
</figure>
<p>
By convention, the frame for <c>main</c> is at the top, and the stack of other frames grows down.
That way, we can draw stack diagrams on paper without needing to guess how far they will grow.
The frame for <c>main</c> is empty because <c>main</c> does not have any variables.
(It has the parameter <c>args</c>, but since we're not using it, we left it out of the diagram.)
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>base case</h></idx>
There are four frames for <c>countdown</c>, each with a different value for the parameter <c>n</c>.
The last frame, with <c>n == 0</c>, is called the <em>base case</em>.
It does not make a recursive call, so there are no more frames below it.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>StackOverflowError</h></idx>
<idx><h>exception</h><h>StackOverflow</h></idx>
If there is no base case in a recursive method, or if the base case is never reached, the stack would grow forever<mdash/>at least in theory.
In practice, the size of the stack is limited.
If you exceed the limit, you get a <c>StackOverflowError</c>.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is a recursive method without a base case:
</p>

<program>
public static void forever(String s) {
System.out.println(s);
forever(s);
}
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>call stack</h></idx>
This method displays the given string until the stack overflows, at which point it throws an error.
Try this example on your computer<mdash/>you might be surprised by how long the error message is!
