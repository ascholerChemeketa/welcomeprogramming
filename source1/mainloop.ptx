<title>The Simulation Loop</title>
<p>
At the end of <c>main</c>, we call <c>mainloop</c>, which uses a <c>while</c> loop to simulate the time steps of the Game of Life.
Here's a rough draft of this method:
</p>

<program>
private void mainloop() {
while (true) {
this.update();
grid.repaint();
Thread.sleep(500); // compiler error
}
}
</program>

<p>
During each time step, we update the state of the game and repaint the <c>grid</c>.
We will present the <c>update</c> method in <xref ref="sec_update">Section</xref>.
</p>

<p>
<c>repaint</c> comes from the <c>Canvas</c> class.
By default, it calls the <c>paint</c> method we provided, which calls <c>draw</c>.
The reason we use it here is that <c>repaint</c> does not require a <c>Graphics</c> object as a parameter.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>Thread.sleep</h></idx>
<idx><h>sleep</h></idx>
<c>Thread.sleep(500)</c> causes the program to <q>sleep</q> for 500 milliseconds, or a half second.
Otherwise, the program would run so fast we would not be able to see the animation.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>InterruptedException</h></idx>
<idx><h>exception</h><h>Interrupted</h></idx>
There's just one problem: compiling this code results in the error <q>unreported exception InterruptedException</q>.
This message means we need to do some exception handling.
